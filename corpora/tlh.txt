        1. Open now Thy gates of beauty,
        1. Open now Thy gates of beauty,
        Zion, let me enter there,
        Where my soul in joyful duty
        Waits for Him who answers prayer.
        Oh, how blessed is this place,
        Filled with solace, light, and grace!

        2. Lord, my God, I come before Thee,
        Come Thou also unto me;
        Where we find Thee and adore Thee,
        There a heaven on earth must be.
        To my heart, oh, enter Thou,
        Let it be Thy temple now!

        3. Here Thy praise is gladly chanted,
        Here Thy seed is duly sown;
        Let my soul, where it is planted,
        Bring forth precious sheaves alone,
        So that all I hear may be
        Fruitful unto life in me.

        4. Thou my faith increase and quicken,
        Let me keep Thy gift divine,
        Howsoe'er temptations thicken;
        May Thy Word still o'er me shine
        As my guiding star through life,
        As my comfort in my strife.

        5. Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee,
        Let Thy will be done indeed;
        May I undisturbed draw near Thee
        While Thou dost Thy people feed.
        Here of life the fountain flows,
        Here is balm for all our woes.



        1. To Thy temple I repair;
        1. To Thy temple I repair;
        Lord, I love to worship there
        When within the veil I meet
        Christ before the mercy-seat.

        2. I through Him am reconciled,
        I through Him become Thy child.
        Abba, Father, give me grace
        In Thy courts to seek Thy face.

        3. While Thy glorious praise is sung,
        Touch my lips, unloose my tongue,
        That my joyful soul may bless
        Christ the Lord, my Righteousness.

        4. While the prayers of saints ascend,
        God of Love, to mine attend.
        Hear me, for Thy Spirit pleads;
        Hear, for Jesus intercedes.

        5. While I hearken to Thy Law,
        Fill my soul with humble awe
        Till Thy Gospel bring to me
        Life and immortality.

        6. While Thy ministers proclaim
        Peace and pardon in Thy name,
        Through their voice, by faith, may I
        Hear Thee speaking from the sky.

        7. From Thy house when I return,
        May my heart within me burn
        And at evening let me say,
        "I have walked with God today."


        1. Lord Jesus Christ, be present now,
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, be present now,
        Our hearts in true devotion bow,
        Thy Spirit send with grace divine,
        And let Thy truth within us shine.

        2. Unseal our lips to sing Thy praise,
        Our souls to Thee in worship raise,
        Make strong our faith, increase our light
        That we may know Thy name aright;

        3. Until we join the hosts that cry,
        "Holy art Thou, O Lord, most high!"
        And in the light of that blest place
        Fore'er behold Thee face to face.

        4. Glory to God the Father, Son,
        And Holy Spirit, Three in One!
        To Thee, O blessed Trinity,
        Be praise throughout eternity!

        1. God Himself is present:
        1. God Himself is present:
        Let us now adore Him
        And with awe appear before Him.
        God is in His temple--
        All within keep silence,
        Prostrate lie with deepest reverence.
        Him alone God we own,
        Him, our God and Savior;
        Praise His name forever.

        2. God Himself is present:
        Hear the harps resounding;
        See the hosts the throne surrounding!
        "Holy, holy, holy"--
        Hear the hymn ascending,
        Songs of saints and angels blending.
        Bow Thine ear To us here:
        Hear, O Christ, the praises
        That Thy Church now raises.

        3. O Thou Fount of blessing,
        Purify my spirit,
        Trusting only in Thy merit.
        Like the holy angels,
        Who behold Thy glory,
        May I ceaselessly adore Thee.
        Let Thy will Ever still
        Rule Thy Church terrestrial
        As the hosts celestial.


        1. Lord, open Thou my heart to hear
        1. Lord, open Thou my heart to hear
        And through Thy Word to me draw near;
        Let me Thy Word e'er pure retain,
        Let me Thy child and heir remain.

        2. Thy Word doth deeply move the heart,
        Thy Word doth perfect health impart,
        Thy Word my soul with joy doth bless,
        Thy Word brings peace and happiness.

        3. To God, the Father, God the Son,
        And God the Spirit, Three in One,
        Shall glory, praise and honor be
        Now and throughout eternity.

        1. Father, who the light this day
        1. Father, who the light this day
        Out of darkness didst create,
        Shine upon us now, we pray,
        While within Thy courts we wait.
        Wean us from the works of night,
        Make us children of the light.

        2. Savior, who this day didst break
        The dark prison of the tomb,
        Bid our slumbering souls awake,
        Shine through all their sin and gloom;
        Let us, from our bonds set free,
        Rise from sin and live to Thee.

        3. Blessed Spirit, Comforter,
        Sent this day from Christ on high,
        Lord, on us Thy gifts confer,
        Cleanse, illumine, sanctify.
        All Thy fulness shed abroad;
        Lead us to the truth of God.


        1. O day of rest and gladness,
        1. O day of rest and gladness,
        O day of joy and light,
        O balm of care and sadness,
        Most beautiful, most bright,
        On thee the high and lowly
        Before the eternal throne
        Sing, "Holy, holy, holy,"
        To the great Three in One.

        2. On thee at the Creation
        The light first had its birth;
        On thee for our salvation
        Christ rose from depth of earth;
        On thee our Lord victorious
        The Spirit sent from heaven,
        And thus on thee, most glorious,
        A threefold light was given.

        3. Thou art a cooling fountain
        In life's dry, dreary sand;
        From thee, like Nebo's mountain,
        We view our Promised Land;
        A day of sweet reflection,
        A day of holy love,
        A day of resurrection
        From earth to things above.

        4. Today on weary nations
        The heavenly manna falls;
        To holy convocations
        The silver trumpet calls,
        Where Gospel-light is glowing
        With pure and radiant beams
        And living water flowing
        With soul-refreshing streams.

        5. New graces ever gaining
        From this our day of rest,
        We reach the rest remaining
        To spirits of the blest.
        To Holy Ghost be praises,
        To Father, and to Son;
        The Church her voice upraises
        To Thee, blest Three in One.


        1. This is the day the Lord hath made;
        1. This is the day the Lord hath made;
        He calls the hours His own;
        Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad
        And praise surround the throne.

        2. Today He rose and left the dead.
        And Satan's empire fell;
        Today the saints His triumphs spread
        And all His wonders tell.

        3. Hosanna to the anointed King
        To David's holy Son!
        Help us, O Lord; descend and bring
        Salvation from the throne.

        4. Blest be the Lord, who comes to men
        With messages of grace;
        Who comes in God His Father's name
        To save our sinful race.

        5. Hosanna in the highest strains
        The Church on earth can raise.
        The highest heavens, in which He reigns,
        Shall give Him nobler praise.


        1. Safely through another week
        1. Safely through another week
        God has brought us on our way;
        Let us now a blessing seek,
        Waiting in His courts today:
        Day of all the week the best,
        Emblem of eternal rest.

        2. Mercies multilpied each hour
        Through the week our praise demand;
        Guarded by almighty power,
        Fed and guided by His hand,
        How ungrateful we have been
        In repaying love with sin!

        3. While we pray for pard'ning grace
        Through the dear Redeemer's name,
        Show Thy reconciled face,
        Look not on our sin and shame.
        From our worldly cares set free,
        May we rest this day in Thee!

        4. As we come Thy name to praise,
        May we feel Thy presence near;
        May Thy glory meet our eyes
        While we in Thy house appear!
        Here afford us, Lord, a taste
        Of our everlasting feast.

        5. May Thy Gospel's joyful sound
        Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
        Make the fruits of grace abound,
        Bring relief for all complaints.
        Thus may all our Sabbaths prove
        Till we join the Church above.

        1. This day at Thy creating word
        1. This day at Thy creating word
        First o'er the earth the light was poured:
        O Lord, this day upon us shine
        And fill our souls with light divine.

        2. This day the Lord for sinners slain
        In might victorious rose again:
        O Jesus, may we raised be
        From death of sin to life in Thee!

        3. This day the Holy Spirit came
        With fiery tongues of cloven flame:
        O Spirit, fill our hearts this day
        With grace to hear and grace to pray.

        4. O day of light and life and grace,
        From earthly toil sweet resting-place,
        Thy hallowed hours, blest gift of love,
        Give we again to God above.

        5. All praise to God the Father be,
        All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
        Whom, with the Spirit, we adore
        Forever and forevermore.

        1. Before Jehovah's awe-full throne,
        1. Before Jehovah's awe-full throne,
        Ye nations, bow with sacred joy.
        Know that the Lord is God alone;
        He can create and He destroy.

        2. His sov'reign power, without our aid,
        Made us of clay and formed us men;
        And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
        He brought us to His fold again.

        3. We are His people, we His care,
        Our souls and all our mortal frame.
        What lasting honors shall we rear,
        Almighty Maker, to Thy name?

        4. We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,
        High as the heavens our voices raise;
        And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
        Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.

        5. Wide as the world is Thy command,
        Vast as eternity Thy love;
        Firm as a rock Thy truth must stand
        When rolling years shall cease to move.

        1. All people that on earth do dwell,
        1. All people that on earth do dwell,
        Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice,
        Him serve with fear, His praise forthtell;
        Come ye before Him and rejoice.

        2. The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
        Without our aid He did us make.
        We are His folk, He doth us feed,
        And for His sheep He doth us take.

        3. Oh, enter, then, His gates with praise,
        Approach with joy His courts unto;
        Praise, laud, and bless His name always.
        For it is seemly so to do.

        4. For why? The Lord, our God, is good;
        His mercy is forever sure.
        His truth at all times firmly stood
        And shall from age to age endure.

        5. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        To God whom heaven and earth adore,
        From men and from the angel host
        Be praise and glory evermore.

        1. From all that dwell below the skies
        1. From all that dwell below the skies
        Let the Creator's praise arise;
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Let the Redeemer's name be sung
        Through every land, by every tongue.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        2. Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord;
        Eternal truth attends Thy Word:
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore
        Till suns shall rise and set no more.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        1. Blessed Jesus, at Thy word
        1. Blessed Jesus, at Thy word
        We are gathered all to hear Thee;
        Let our hearts and souls be stirred
        Now to seek and love and fear Thee,
        By Thy teachings, sweet and holy,
        Drawn from earth to love Thee solely.

        2. All our knowledge, sense, and sight
        Lie in deepest darkness shrouded
        Till Thy Spirit breaks our night
        With the beams of truth unclouded.
        Thou alone to God canst win us;
        Thou must work all good within us.

        3. Glorious Lord, Thyself impart,
        Light of Light, from God proceeding;
        Open Thou our ears and heart,
        Help us by Thy Spirit's pleading;
        Hear the cry Thy people raises,
        Hear and bless our prayers and praises.

        4. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        Praise to Thee and adoration!
        Grant that we Thy Word may trust
        And obtain true consolation
        While we here below must wander,
        Till we sing Thy praises yonder.

        1. Oh, worship the King
        1. Oh, worship the King
        All glorious above:
        Oh, gratefully sing
        His power and His love,
        Our Shield and Defender,
        The Ancient of Days,
        Pavilioned in splendor
        And girded with praise!

        2. Oh, tell of His might,
        Oh, sing of His grace,
        Whose robe is the light,
        Whose canopy space!
        His chariots of wrath
        The deep thunder-clouds form,
        And dark is His path
        On the wings of the storm.

        3. This earth, with its store
        Of wonders untold,
        Almighty, Thy power
        Hath founded of old,
        Hath stablished it fast
        By a changeless decree,
        And round it hath cast,
        Like a mantle, the sea.

        4. Thy bountiful care
        What tongues can recite?
        It breathes in the air,
        It shines in the light,
        It streams from the hills,
        It descends to the plain,
        And sweetly distils
        In the dew and the rain.

        5. Frail children of dust
        And feeble as frail,
        In Thee do we trust
        Nor find Thee to fail.
        Thy mercies, how tender,
        How firm to the end,
        Our maker, Defender,
        Redeemer, and Friend!

        6. O measureless Might,
        Ineffable Love,
        While angels delight
        To hymn Thee above,
        Thy humbler creation,
        Though feeble their lays,
        With true adoration
        Shall sing to Thy praise.

        1. Lord, we come before Thee now,
        1. Lord, we come before Thee now,
        At Thy feet we humbly bow:
        Oh, do not our suit disdain!
        Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

        2. Lord, on Thee our souls depend;
        In compassion now descend,
        Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace,
        Tune our lips to sing Thy praise.

        3. In Thine own appointed way
        Now we seek Thee, here we stay.
        Lord, we know not how to go
        Till a blessing Thou bestow.

        4. Send some message from Thy Word
        That may peace and joy afford;
        Let Thy Spirit now impart
        Full salvation to each heart.

        5. Comfort those who weep and mourn,
        Let the time of joy return;
        Those that are cast down lift up,
        Make them strong in faith and hope.

        6. Grant that all may seek and find
        Thee a gracious God and kind.
        Heal the sick, the captive free;
        Let us all rejoice in Thee.

        1. All praise to God, who reigns above,
        1. All praise to God, who reigns above,
        The God of all creation,
        The God of wonders, power, and love,
        The God of our salvation!
        With healing balm my soul He fills,
        The God who every sorrow stills,--
        To God all praise and glory!

        2. What God's almighty power hath made
        His gracious mercy keepeth;
        By morning dawn or evening shade
        His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth;
        Within the kingdom of His might
        Lo, all is just and all is right,--
        To God all praise and glory!

        3. I cried to Him in time of need:
        Lord God, oh, hear my calling!
        For death He gave me life indeed
        And kept my feet from falling.
        For this my thanks shall endless be;
        Oh, thank Him, thank our God, with me,--
        To God all praise and glory!

        4. The Lord forsaketh not His flock,
        His chosen generation;
        He is their Refuge and their Rock,
        Their Peace and their Salvation.
        As with a mother's tender hand
        He leads His own, His chosen band,--
        To God all praise and glory!

        5. Ye who confess Christ's holy name,
        To God give praise and glory!
        Ye who the Father's power proclaim,
        To God give praise and glory!
        All idols under foot be trod,
        The Lord is God! The Lord is God!
        To God all praise and glory!

        6. Then come before His presence now
        And banish fear and sadness;
        To your Redeemer pay your vow
        And sing with joy and gladness:
        Though great distress my soul befell,
        The Lord, my God, did all things well,--
        To God all praise and glory!

        1. God of mercy, God of grace,
        1. God of mercy, God of grace,
        Show the brightness of Thy face;
        Shine upon us, Savior, shine,
        Fill Thy church with light divine,
        And Thy saving health extend
        Unto earth's remotest end.

        2. Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
        Be by all that live adored;
        Let the nations shout and sing
        Glory to their Savior King,
        At Thy feet their tribute pay,
        And Thy holy will obey.

        3. Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
        Earth shall then her fruits afford,
        God to man His blessing give,
        Man to God devoted live;
        All below and all above
        One in joy and light and love.

        1. Jehovah, let me now adore Thee,
        1. Jehovah, let me now adore Thee,
        For where is there a God such, Lord, as Thou?
        With songs I fain would come before Thee;
        Oh, let Thy Holy Spirit teach me now
        To praise Thee in His name through whom alone
        Our songs can please Thee, through Thy blessed Son!

        2. O Father, draw me to my Savior
        That Thy dear Son may draw me unto Thee;
        Thy Spirit guide my whole behavior
        And rule both sense and reason thus in me
        That, Lord, Thy peace from me may ne'er depart,
        But wake sweet melodies within my heart.

        3. Grant that Thy Spirit prompt my praises,
        Then shall my singing surely please Thine ear;
        Sweet are the sounds my heart then raises,
        My prayer in truth and spirit Thou wilt hear.
        Then shall Thy Spirit raise my heart to Thee
        To sing Thee psalms of praise in high degree.

        4. For He can plead for me with sighings
        That are unspeakable to lips like mine;
        He bids me pray with earnest cryings,
        Bears witness with my soul that I am Thine,
        Joint heir with Christ, and thus may dare to say:
        O heavenly Father, hear me when I pray!

        5. When thus my heart in prayer ascendeth,
        Through Thine own Holy Spirit, unto Thee,
        Thy heart, O Father, kindly bendeth
        Its fervent love and favor unto me,
        Rejoicing my petition to fulfil
        Which I have made according to Thy will.

        6. And what Thy Spirit thus hath taught me
        To seek from Thee must needs be such a prayer
        As Thou wilt grant through Him who bought me
        And raised me up to be Thy child and heir.
        In Jesus name I boldly seek Thy face
        And take from Thee, my Father, grace for grace.

        1. Lord, when we bend before Thy throne
        1. Lord, when we bend before Thy throne
        And our confessions pour,
        Teach us to feel the sins we own
        And hate what we deplore.

        2. Our broken spirit pitying see,
        True penitence impart;
        Then let a kindling glance from Thee
        Beam hope upon the heart.

        3. When our responsive tongues essay
        Their grateful hymns to raise,
        Grant that our souls may join the lay
        And mount to Thee in praise.

        4. When we disclose our wants in prayer,
        May we our wills resign
        And not a thought our bosom share
        That is not wholly Thine.

        5. May faith each meek petition fill
        And waft it to the skies;
        And teach our hearts 'tis goodness still
        That grants it or denies.

        1. Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
        1. Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
        To God the Father let us bring
        Our songs of adoration.
        To Him through everlasting days
        Be worship, honor, power, and praise,
        Whose hand sustains creation.
        Singing, ringing:
        Holy, holy, God is holy,--
        Spread the story
        Of our God, the Lord of Glory.

        2. Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
        Unto the Lamb of God we sing,
        In whom we are elected.
        He bought His church with His own blood,
        He cleansed her in that blessed flood,
        And as His Bride selected.
        Holy, holy
        Is our union And communion.
        His befriending
        Gives us joy and peace unending.

        3. Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
        Unto the Holy Ghost we sing
        For our regeneration.
        The saving faith in us He wrought
        And us unto the Bridegroom brought,
        Made us His chosen nation.
        Glory! Glory!
        Joy eternal, Bliss supernal;
        There is manna
        And an endless, glad hosanna.

        4. Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
        Unto our Triune God we sing;
        Blest be His name forever!
        With angel hosts let us adore
        And sing His praises more and more
        For all His grace and favor!
        Singing, ringing:
        Holy, holy, God is holy,--
        Spread the story
        Of our God, the Lord of Glory! 

        1. Lord of my life, whose tender care
        1. Lord of my life, whose tender care
        Hath led me on till now,
        Here lowly, at the hour of prayer,
        Before Thy throne I bow.
        I bless Thy gracious hand and pray
        Forgiveness for another day.

        2. Oh, may I daily, hourly, strive
        In heavenly grace to grow,
        To Thee and to Thy glory live,
        Dead to all else below!
        Tread in the path my Savior trod,
        Though thorny, yet the path of God.

        3. With prayer my humble praise I bring
        For mercies day by day.
        Lord, teach my heart Thy love to sing;
        Lord, teach me how to pray.
        All that I have and am, to Thee
        I offer through eternity.

        1. I will sing my Maker's praises
        1. I will sing my Maker's praises
        And in Him most joyful be,
        For in all things I see traces
        Of His tender love to me.
        Nothing else than love could move Him
        With such sweet and tender care
        Evermore to raise and bear
        All who try to serve and love Him.
        All things else have but their day,
        God's great love abides for aye.

        2. Yea, so dear did He esteem me
        That His Son He loved so well
        He hath given to redeem me
        From the quenchless flames of hell.
        O Thou Spring of boundless blessing,
        How could e'er my feeble mind
        Of Thy depth the bottom find
        Though my efforts were unceasing?
        All things else have but their day,
        God's great love abides for aye.

        3. All that for my soul is needful
        He with loving care provides,
        Nor of that is He unheedful
        Which my body needs besides.
        When my strength cannot avail me,
        When my powers can do no more,
        Doth my God His strength outpour;
        In my need He doth not fail me.
        All things else have but their day,
        God's great love abides for aye.

        4. When I sleep, He still is near me,
        O'er me rests His guardian eye;
        And new gifts and blessings cheer me
        When the morning streaks the sky.
        Were it not for God's protection,
        Had His countenance not been
        Here my guide, I had not seen
        E'er the end of my affliction.
        All things else have but their day,
        God's great love abides for aye.

        5. As a father never turneth
        Wholly from a wayward child,
        For the prodigal still yearneth,
        Longing to be reconciled,
        So my many sins and errors
        Find a tender, pardoning God,
        Chastening frailty with His rod,
        Not in vengeance, with His terrors.
        All things else have but their day,
        God's great love abides for aye.

        6. Since, then, neither change nor coldness
        In my Father's love can be,
        Lo! I lift my hands with boldness,
        As Thy child I come to Thee.
        Grant me grace, O God, I pray Thee,
        That I may with all my might,
        All my lifetime, day and night,
        Love and trust Thee and obey Thee
        And, when this brief life is o'er,
        Praise and love Thee evermore.
        1. Praise the Almighty, my soul, adore Him!
        1. Praise the Almighty, my soul, adore Him!
        Yea, I will laud Him until death.
        With songs and anthems I'll come before Him
        As long as He doth give me breath.
        From Him my life and all things came;
        Bless, O my soul, His holy name.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        2. Trust not in princes, they are but mortal;
        Earth-born they are and soon decay.
        Naught are their counsels at life's last portal,
        When the dark grave doth claim its prey.
        Since, then, no man can help afford,
        Trust ye in Christ, our God and Lord. 
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        3. Blessed, yea, blessed is he forever
        Whose help is in the Lord most high,
        Whom from the saving faith naught can sever
        And who in hope to Christ draws nigh.
        To all who trust in Him, our Lord,
        Counsel and aid He doth afford.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        4. God the Almighty, the great Creator,
        Ruler of sky and land and sea,
        All things ordained, and sooner or later
        They come to pass unfailingly.
        His rule is over rich and poor,
        His promise ever standeth sure.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        5. Penitent sinners, for mercy crying,
        Pardon and peace from Him obtain;
        Ever the wants of the poor supplying,
        Their faithful God He doth remain.
        He helps His children in distress,
        The widows and the fatherless.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        6. Praise, O mankind, now the name so holy
        Of Him who doth such wondrous things!
        All that hath being, to praise Him solely,
        With happy heart its "Amen" sings!
        Children of God, with angel host
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        1. Oh, bless the Lord, my soul!
        1. Oh, bless the Lord, my soul!
        Let all within me join
        And aid my tongue to bless His name
        Whose favors are divine.

        2. Oh, bless the Lord, my soul,
        Nor let His mercies lie
        Forgotten in unthankfulness
        And without praises die!

        3. 'Tis He forgives thy sins;
        'Tis He relieves thy pain;
        'Tis He that heals thy sicknesses
        And makes thee young again.

        4. He crowns thy life with love
        When ransomed from the grave;
        He that redeemed my soul from hell
        Hath sovereign power to save.

        5. He fills the poor with good;
        He gives the sufferers rest:
        The Lord hath judgments for the proud
        And justice for the opprest.

        6. His wondrous works and ways
        He made by Moses known,
        But sent the world His truth and grace
        By His beloved Son.

        1. Now let all loudly
        1. Now let all loudly
        Sing praise to God the Lord;
        Christendom, proudly
        Laud Him with one accord.
        Gently He bids thee come before Him;
        Haste, then, O Israel, now adore Him.

        2. For the Lord reigneth
        Over the universe,
        All He sustaineth,
        All things His praise rehearse,
        The angel host His glory telling,
        Psalter and harp are the anthem swelling.

        3. Come, heathen races,
        Cast off all grief and care,
        For pleasant places
        Your Savior doth prepare
        Where His blest Word abroad is sounded,
        Pardon for sinners and grace unbounded.

        4. Richly He feeds us
        Always and everywhere;
        Gently He leads us
        With a true father's care;
        The late and early rains He sends us,
        Daily His blessing, His love, attends us.

        5. Sing we His praises
        Who is thus merciful;
        Christendom raises
        Songs to His glorious rule.
        Rejoice! No foe shall now alarm us;
        He will protect us, and who can harm us?

        1. Through all the changing scenes of life,
        1. Through all the changing scenes of life,
        In trouble and in joy,
        The praises of my God shall still
        My heart and tongue employ.

        2. Of His deliverance I will boast
        Till all that are distrest
        From my example comfort take
        And charm their griefs to rest.

        3. Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
        With me exalt His name!
        When in distress to Him I cried,
        He to my rescue came.

        4. The hosts of God encamp around
        The dwellings of the just;
        Deliverance He affords to all
        Who on His succor trust.

        5. Oh, make but trial of His love!
        Experience will decide
        How blest are they, and only they,
        Who is His truth confide.

        6. Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
        Have nothing else to fear;
        Make you His service your delight,
        He'll make your wants His care.

        1. Oh that I had a thousand voices
        1. Oh that I had a thousand voices
        To praise my God with thousand tongues!
        My heart, which in the Lord rejoices,
        Would then proclaim in grateful songs
        To all, wherever I might be,
        What great things God hath done for me.

        2. O all ye powers that He implanted,
        Arise, and silence keep no more;
        Put forth the strength that He hath granted,
        Your noblest work is to adore.
        O soul and body, be ye meet
        With heartfelt praise your Lord to greet!

        3. Ye forest leaves so green and tender,
        That dance for joy in summer air;
        Ye meadow grasses, bright and slender;
        Ye flowers so wondrous sweet and fair;
        Ye live to show His praise alone,
        With me now make His glory known.

        4. All creatures that have breath and motion,
        That throng the earth, the sea, the sky,
        Now join me in my heart's devotion,
        Help me to raise His praises high,
        My utmost powers can ne'er aright
        Declare the wonders of His might.

        5. Lord, I will tell, while I am living,
        Thy goodness forth with every breath
        And greet each morning with thanksgiving
        Until my heart is still in death;
        Yea, when at last my lips grow cold,
        Thy praise shall in my sighs be told.

        6. O Father, deign Thou, I beseech Thee,
        To listen to my earthly lays;
        A nobler strain in heaven shall reach Thee,
        When I with angels hymn Thy praise
        And learn amid their choirs to sing
        Loud hallelujahs to my King.

        1. When all Thy mercies, O my God,
        1. When all Thy mercies, O my God,
        My rising soul surveys,
        Transported with the view, I'm lost
        In wonder, love, and praise.

        2. Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
        My daily thanks employ;
        Nor is the least a cheerful heart
        That tastes those gifts with joy.

        3. Through every period of my life
        Thy goodness I'll pursue
        And after death, in distant worlds,
        The glorious theme renew.

        4. When nature fails, and day and night
        Divide Thy works no more,
        My ever grateful heart, O Lord,
        Thy mercies shall adore.

        5. Through all eternity to Thee
        A joyful song I'll raise;
        But, oh! eternity's too short
        To utter all Thy praise.

        1. Redeemed, restored, forgiven,
        1. Redeemed, restored, forgiven,
        Through Jesus precious blood,
        Heirs of His home in heaven,
        Oh, praise our pardoning God!
        Praise Him in tuneful measures
        Who gave His Son to die;
        Praise Him whose sevenfold treasures
        Enrich and sanctify.

        2. Once on the dreary mountain
        We wandered far and wide,
        Far from the cleansing fountain,
        Far from the pierced side;
        But Jesus sought and found us
        And washed our guilt away;
        With cords of love He bound us
        To be His own for aye.

        3. Dear Master, Thine the glory
        Of each recovered soul.
        Ah! who can tell the story
        Of love that made us whole?
        Not ours, not ours, the merit;
        Be thine alone the praise
        And ours a thankful spirit
        To serve Thee all our days.

        4. Now keep us, holy Savior,
        In Thy true love and fear
        And grant us of Thy favor
        The grace to persevere
        Till, in Thy new creation,
        Earth's time-long travail o'er,
        We find our full salvation
        And praise Thee evermore.

        1. The Lord hath helped me hitherto
        1. The Lord hath helped me hitherto
        By His surpassing favor;
        His mercies every morn were new,
        His kindness did not waver.
        God hitherto hath been my Guide,
        Hath pleasures hitherto supplied,
        And hitherto hath helped me.

        2. I praise and thank Thee, Lord, my God,
        For Thine abundant blessing
        Which heretofore Thou hast bestowed
        And I am still possessing.
        Inscribe this on my memory:
        The Lord hath done great things for me
        And graciously hath helped me.

        3. Help me henceforth, O God of grace,
        Help me on each occasion,
        Help me in each and every place,
        Help me through Jesus Passion;
        Help me in life and death, O God,
        Help me through Jesus dying blood;
        Help me as Thou hast helped me!

        1. My soul, now bless thy Maker!
        1. My soul, now bless thy Maker!
        Let all within me bless His name
        Who maketh thee partaker
        Of mercies more than thou dar'st claim.
        Forget Him not whose meekness
        Still bears with all thy sin,
        Who healeth all thy weakness,
        Renews thy life within;
        Whose grace and care are endless
        And saved thee through the past;
        Who leaves no sufferer friendless,
        But rights the wronged at last.

        2. He shows to man His treasure
        Of judgment, truth, and righteousness,
        His love beyond all measure,
        His yearning pity o'er distress,
        Nor treats us as we merit,
        But lays His anger by,
        The humble, contrite spirit
        Finds His compassion nigh;
        And high as heaven above us,
        As break from close of day,
        So far, since He doth love us,
        He puts our sins away.

        3. For as a tender father
        Hath pity on his children here,
        He in His arms will gather
        All who are His in childlike fear.
        He knows how frail our powers
        Who but from dust are made;
        We flourish like the fowers,
        And even so we fade;
        The wind but o'er them passes,
        And all their bloom is o'er,-
        We wither like the grasses,
        Our place knows us no more.

        4. God's grace alone endureth,
        And children's children yet shall prove
        How He with strength assureth
        The hearts of all that seek His love.
        In heaven is fixed His dwelling,
        His rule is over all;
        Angels, in might excelling,
        Bright hosts, before Him fall.
        Praise Him, who ever reigneth,
        All ye who hear His Word,
        Nor our poor hymns disdaineth-
        My soul, oh, bless the Lord!

        1. Songs of praise the angels sang,
        1. Songs of praise the angels sang,
        Heaven with alleluias rang,
        When creation was begun,
        When God spake and it was done.

        2. Songs of praise awoke the morn
        When the Prince of Peace was born;
        Songs of praise arose when He
        Captive led captivity.

        3. Heaven and earth must pass away;
        Songs of praise shall crown that day.
        God will make new heavens and earth;
        Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

        4. And shall man alone be dumb
        Till that glorious kingdom come?
        No; the Church delights to raise
        Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.

        5. Saints below, with heart and voice,
        Still in songs of praise rejoice;
        Learning here, by faith and love,
        Songs of praise to sing above.

        6. Borne upon their latest breath,
        Songs of praise shall conquer death;
        Then, amidst eternal joy,
        Songs of praise their powers employ.

        1. Now thank we all our God
        1. Now thank we all our God
        With heart and hands and voices,
        Who wondrous things hath done,
        In whom His world rejoices;
        Who from our mother's arms
        Hath blessed us on our way
        With countless gifts of love,
        And still is ours today.

        2. Oh, may this bounteous God
        Through all our life be near us,
        With ever joyful hearts
        And blessed peace to cheer us;
        And keep us in His grace
        And guide us when perplexed
        And free us from all ills
        In this world and the next.

        3. All praise and thanks to God
        The Father now be given,
        The Son, and Him who reigns
        With them in highest heaven:
        The one eternal God,
        Whom earth and heaven adore!
        For thus it was, is now,
        And shall be evermore.

        1. Lord, 'tis not that I did choose Thee;
        1. Lord, 'tis not that I did choose Thee;
        That, I know, could never be;
        For this heart would still refuse Thee
        Had Thy grace not chosen me.
        Thou hast from the sin that stained me
        Washed and cleansed and set me free
        And unto this end ordained me,
        That I ever live to Thee.

        2. 'Twas Thy grace in Christ that called me,
        Taught my darkened heart and mind;
        Else the world had yet enthralled me,
        To Thy heavenly glories blind.
        Now my heart owns none above Thee;
        For Thy grace alone I thirst,
        Knowing well that, if I love Thee,
        Thou, O Lord, didst love me first.

        3. Praise the God of all creation;
        Praise the Father's boundless love.
        Praise the Lamb, our Expiation,
        Priest and King enthroned above.
        Praise the Spirit of salvation,
        Him by whom our spirits live.
        Undivided adoration
        To the great Jehovah give.

        1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
        1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
        O my soul, praise Him, for He is Thy Health and Salvation!
        Join the full throng:
        Wake, harp and psalter and song;
        Sound forth in glad adoration!

        2. Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
        Who, as on wings of an eagle, uplifteth, sustaineth.
        Hast thou not seen
        How thy desires all have been
        Granted in what He ordaineth?

        3. Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;
        Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
        What need or grief
        Ever hath failed of relief?--
        Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

        4. Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee,
        Who from the heavens the streams of His mercy doth send thee.
        Ponder anew
        What the Almighty can do,
        Who with His love doth befriend thee.

        5. Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that is in me adore Him!
        All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
        Let the Amen
        Sound from His people again;
        Gladly for aye we adore Him.

        1. The God of Abraham praise;
        1. The God of Abraham praise;
        All praised be His name
        Who was and is and is to be
        And still the same!
        The one eternal God,
        Ere aught that now appears;
        The First, the Last: beyond all thought
        His timeless years!

        2. The God of Abraham praise,
        At whose supreme command
        From earth I rise and seek the joys
        At His right hand.
        I all on earth forsake,
        Its wisdom, fame, and power,
        And Him my only Portion make,
        My Shield and Tower.

        3. He by Himself hath sworn,--
        I on His oath depend,--
        I shall, on eagles wings upborne,
        To heaven ascend;
        I shall behold His face,
        I shall His power adore
        And sing the wonders of His grace
        Forevermore.

        4. The whole triumphant host
        Give thanks to God on high;
        "Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
        They ever cry.
        Hail, Abraham's God and mine!--
        I join the heavenly lays,--
        All might and majesty are Thine,
        And endless praise.

        1. We sing the almighty power of God,
        1. We sing the almighty power of God,
        Who bade the mountains rise,
        Who spread the flowing seas abroad
        And built the lofty skies.

        2. We sing the wisdom that ordained
        The sun to rule the day;
        The moon shines, too, at His command,
        And all the stars obey.

        3. We sing the goodness of the Lord,
        Who fills the earth with food,
        Who formed His creatures by a word
        And then pronounced them good.

        4. Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed
        Where'er we turn our eyes,
        Whene'er we view the ground we tread
        Or gaze upon the skies!

        5. There's not a plant nor flower below
        But makes Thy glories known;
        And clouds arise and tempests blow
        By order from Thy throne.

        6. On Thee each moment we depend;
        If Thou withdraw, we die.
        Oh, may we ne'er that God offend
        Who is forever nigh!

        1. Ye lands, to the Lord make a jubilant noise;
        1. Ye lands, to the Lord make a jubilant noise;
        Glory be to God!
        Oh, serve Him with joy, in His presence now rejoice;
        Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

        2. Not we, but the Lord is our Maker, our God;
        Glory be to God!
        His people we are, and the sheep led by His rod;
        Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

        3. Oh, enter His gates with thanksgiving and praise;
        Glory be to God!
        To bless Him and thank Him our voices we will raise;
        Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

        4. For good is the Lord, and His mercy is sure;
        Glory be to God!
        To all generations His truth shall still endure;
        Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

        1. Now, the hour of worship o'er,
        1. Now, the hour of worship o'er,
        Teaching, hearing, praying, singing,
        Let us gladly God adore,
        For His Word our praises bringing;
        For the rich repast He gave us
        Bless the Lord, who deigned to save us.
        
        2. Now the Blessing cheers our heart,
        By His grace to us extended.
        Let us joyfully depart;
        Be our souls to God commended.
        May His Spirit ever guide us
        And with all good gifts provide us!
        
        3. Bless our going out, we pray,
        Bless our entrance in like measure;
        Bless our bread, O Lord, each day,
        Bless our toil, our rest, our pleasure;
        Bless us when we reach death's portal,
        Bless us then with life immortal.

        1. On what has now been sown
        1. On what has now been sown
        Thy blessing, Lord, bestow;
        The power is Thine alone
        To make it spring and grow.
        Do Thou in grace the harvest raise,
        And Thou alone shalt have the praise.

        2. To Thee our wants are known,
        From Thee are all our powers;
        Accept what is Thine own
        And pardon what is ours.
        Our praises, Lord, and prayers receive
        And to Thy Word a blessing give.

        3. Oh, grant that each of us
        Now met before Thee here
        May meet together thus
        When Thou and Thine appear
        And follow Thee to heaven, our home.
        E'en so, Amen, Lord Jesus, come!

	1. Savior, again to Thy dear name we raise	
	1. Savior, again to Thy dear name we raise	
 	With one accord our parting hymn of praise.
	Once more we bless Thee ere our worship cease,
	Then, lowly bending, wait Thy word of peace.

	2. Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way;
	With Thee began, with Thee shall end, the day;
	Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame,
	That in this house have called upon Thy name.

	3. Grant us Thy peace, Lord, through the coming night;
	Turn Thou for us its darkness into light.
	From harm and danger keep Thy children free,
	For dark and light are both alike to Thee.

	4. Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life,
	Our balm in sorrow and our stay in strife;
	Then, when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease,
	Call us, O Lord, to Thine eternal peace.

        1. How blest are they who hear God's Word
        1. How blest are they who hear God's Word
        And keep and heed what they have heard!
        They wisdom daily gather;
        Their light shines brighter day by day,
        And while they tread life's weary way,
        They have the oil of gladness
        To soothe their pain and sadness.

        2. God's Word a treasure is to me,
        Through sorrow's night my sun shall be,
        The shield of faith in battle.
        The Father's hand hath written there
        My title as His child and heir,
        "The kingdom's thine forever."
        That promise faileth never.

        3. Today I was my Savior's guest,
        My soul was here so richly blest,
        The Bread of Life receiving.
        Oh, may thereby my faith prevail,
        So that its fruits shall never fail
        Till my account is given
        Before the throne in heaven!

	1. Almighty God, Thy Word is cast
	1. Almighty God, Thy Word is cast
	Like seed into the ground;
	Now let the dew of heaven descend
	And righteous fruits abound.

	2. Let not the foe of Christ and man
	This holy seed remove.
	But give it root in every heart
	To bring forth fruits of love.

	3. Let not the world's deceitful cares
	The rising plant destroy,
	But let it yield a hundredfold
	The fruits of peace and joy.
  
	4. Oft as the precious seed is sown,
	Thy quickening grace bestow
	That all whose souls the truth receive
 	 Its saving power may know.

        1. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
        1. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
        Fill our hearts with joy and peace.
        Let us each, Thy love possessing,
        Triumph in redeeming grace.
        Oh, refresh us, Oh, refresh us,
        Traveling through this wilderness!

        2. Thanks we give and adoration
        For Thy Gospel's joyful sound.
        May the fruits of Thy salvation
        In our hearts and lives abound;
        Ever faithful, Ever faithful,
        To the Truth may we be found!

        3. So, when'er the signal's given
        Us from earth to call away,
        Borne on angels wings to heaven,
        Glad the summons to obey,
        May we ever, May we ever,
        Reign with Christ in endless day!

        1. Now may He who from the dead
        1. Now may He who from the dead
        Brought the Shepherd of the sheep,
        Jesus Christ, our King and Head,
        All our souls in safety keep!

        2. May He teach us to fulfil
        What is pleasing in His sight,
        Perfect us in all His will,
        And preserve us day and night!

        3. To that dear Redeemer's praise,
        Who the covenant sealed with blood,
        Let our hearts and voices raise
        Loud thanksgivings to our God.

        1. Almighty Father, bless the Word
        1. Almighty Father, bless the Word
        Which through Thy grace we now have heard,
        Oh, may the precious seed take root,
        Spring up, and bear abundant fruit!

        2. We praise Thee for the means of grace
        As homeward now our steps we trace.
        Grant, Lord, that we who worshiped here
        May all at last in heaven appear.

        1. Abide, O dearest Jesus,
        1. Abide, O dearest Jesus,
        Among us with Thy grace
        That Satan may not harm us
        Nor we to sin give place.

        2. Abide, O dear Redeemer,
        Among us with Thy Word
        And thus now and hereafter
        True peace and joy afford.

        3. Abide with heavenly brightness
        Among us, precious Light;
        Thy truth direct and keep us
        From error's gloomy night.

        4. Abide with richest blessings
        Among us, bounteous Lord;
        Let us in grace and wisdom
        Grow daily through Thy Word.

        5. Abide with Thy protection
        Among us, Lord, our Strength,
        Lest world and Satan fell us
        And overcome at length.

        6. Abide, O faithful Savior,
        Among us with Thy love;
        Grant steadfastness and help us
        To reach our home above.

        1. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
        1. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
        Pilgrim through this barren land.
        I am weak but Thou art mighty;
        Hold me with Thy powerful hand.
        Bread of heaven,
        Feed me till I want no more.

        2. Open now the crystal fountain
        Whence the healing stream doth flow;
        Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
        Lead me all my journey through.
        Strong Deliverer
        Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

        3. When I tread the verge of Jordan,
        Bid my anxious fears subside;
        Death of death and hell's Destruction,
        Land me safe on Canaan's side.
        Songs of praises
        I will ever give to Thee.

        1. Come, Thou precious Ransom, come,
        1. Come, Thou precious Ransom, come,
        Only Hope for sinful mortals!
        Come, O Savior of the world!
        Open are to Thee all portals.
        Come, Thy beauty let us see;
        Anxiously we wait for Thee.

        2. Enter now my waiting heart,
        Glorious King and Lord most holy.
        Dwell in me and ne'er depart,
        Though I am but poor and lowly.
        Ah, what riches will be mine
        When Thou art my Guest Divine!

        3. My hosannas and my palms
        Graciously receive, I pray Thee;
        Evermore, as best I can,
        Savior, I will homage pay Thee,
        And in faith I will embrace,
        Lord, Thy merit through Thy grace.

        4. Hail, hosanna, David's Son!
        Help, Lord, hear our supplication!
        Let Thy kingdom, scepter, crown,
        Bring us blessing and salvation,
        That forever we may sing:
        Hail, hosanna! to our King.

        1. Jesus came, the heavens adoring,
        1. Jesus came, the heavens adoring,
        Came with peace from realms on high;
        Jesus came for man's redemption,
        Lowly came on earth to die;
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Came in deep humility.

        2. Jesus comes again in mercy
        When our hearts are bowed with care;
        Jesus comes again in answer
        To an earnest, heartfelt prayer;
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Comes to save us from despair.

        3. Jesus comes to hearts rejoicing,
        Bringing news of sins forgiven;
        Jesus comes in sounds of gladness,
        Leading souls redeemed to heaven.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Now the gate of death is riven.

        4. Jesus comes in joy and sorrow,
        Shares alike our hopes and fears;
        Jesus comes, whate'er befalls us,
        Glads our hearts, and dries our tears;
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Cheering e'en our failing years.

        5. Jesus comes on clouds triumphant
        When the heavens shall pass away;
        Jesus comes again in glory.
        Let us, then, our homage pay,
        Alleluia! ever singing
        Till the dawn of endless day.

        1. O bride of Christ, rejoice;
        1. O bride of Christ, rejoice;
        Exultant raise thy voice
        To hail the day of glory
        Foretold in sacerd story.
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        2. Let shouts of gladness rise
        Triumphant to the skies.
        Now comes the King most glorious
        To reign o'er all victorious:
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        3. He wears no kingly crown,
        Yet as a King is known;
        Though not arrayed in splendor,
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        4. The weak and timid find
        How meek He is and kind;
        To them He gives a treasure
        Of bliss beyond all measure.
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        5. Thy heart now open wide,
        Bid Christ with thee abide.
        He graciously will hear thee
        And be forever near thee.
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        6. Then go thy Lord to meet;
        Strew palm-leaves at His feet;
        Thy garments spread before Him
        And honor and adore Him.
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        7. E'en babes with one accord
        With thee shall praise the Lord
        And every Gentile nation
        Respond with exultation:
        Hosanna, praise, and glory!
        Our King, we bow before Thee.

        1. O Lord, how shall I meet Thee,
        1. O Lord, how shall I meet Thee,
        How welcome Thee aright?
        Thy people long to greet Thee,
        My Hope, my heart's Delight!
        O kindle, Lord, most holy,
        Thy lamp within my breast
        To do in spirit lowly
        All that may please Thee best.

        2. Thy Zion strews before Thee
        Green boughs and fairest palms,
        And I, too, will adore Thee
        With joyous songs and psalms.
        My heart shall bloom forever
        For Thee with praises new
        And from Thy name shall never
        Withhold the honor due.

        3. I lay in fetters, groaning,
        Thou com'st to set me free;
        I stood, my shame bemoaning,
        Thou com'st to honor me;
        A glory Thou dost give me,
        A treasure safe on high,
        That will not fail or leave me
        As earthly riches fly.

        4. Love caused Thy incarnation,
        Love brought Thee down to me;
        Thy thirst for my salvation
        Procured my liberty.
        O love beyond all telling,
        That led Thee to embrace,
        In love all love excelling,
        Our lost and fallen race!

        5. Rejoice, then, ye sad-hearted,
        Who sit in deepest gloom,
        Who mourn o'er joys departed
        And tremble at your doom.
        Despair not, He is near you,
        Yea, standing at the door,
        Who best can help and cheer you
        And bids you weep no more.

        6. Ye need not toil nor languish
        Nor ponder day and night
        How in the midst of anguish
        Ye draw Him by your might.
        He comes, He comes all willing,
        Moved by His love alone,
        Your woes and troubles stilling;
        For all to Him are known.

        7. Sin's debt, that fearful burden,
        Let not your souls distress;
        Your guilt the Lord will pardon
        And cover by His grace.
        He comes, for men procuring
        The peace of sin forgiven,
        For all God's sons securing
        Their heritage in heaven.

        8. What though the foes be raging,
        Heed not their craft and spite;
        Your Lord, the battle waging,
        Will scatter all their might.
        He comes, a King most glorious,
        And all His earthly foes
        In vain His course victorious
        Endeavor to oppose.

        9. He comes to judge the nations,
        A terror to His foes,
        A Light of consolations
        And blessed Hope to those
        Who love the Lord's appearing.
        O glorious Sun, now come,
        Send forth Thy beams so cheering,
        An guide us safely home.

        1. Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
        1. Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
        Great David's greater Son!
        Hail, in the time appointed,
        His reign on earth begun!
        He comes to break oppression,
        To set the captive free,
        To take away transgression,
        And rule in equity.

        2. He comes with succor speedy
        To those who suffer wrong;
        To help the poor and needy
        And bid the weak be strong;
        To give them songs for sighing,
        Their darkness turn to light,
        Whose souls, condemned and dying,
        Were precious in His sight.

        3. He shall come down like showers
        Upon the fruitful earth,
        And joy and hope, like flowers,
        Spring in His path to birth.
        Before Him on the mountains
        Shall peace, the herald, go
        And righteousness, in fountains,
        From hill to valley flow.

        4. Arabia's desert ranger
        To Him shall bow the knee,
        The Ethiopian stranger
        His glory come to see;
        With offerings of devotion
        Ships from the isles shall meet
        To pour the wealth of ocean
        In tribute at His feet.

        5. Kings shall bow down before Him
        And gold and incense bring;
        All nations shall adore Him,
        His praise all peoples sing;
        To Him shall prayer unceasing
        And daily vows ascend,
        His kingdom still increasing,
        A kingdom without end.

        6. O'er every foe victorious,
        He on His throne shall rest,
        From age to age more glorious,
        All blessing and all-blest.
        The tide of time shall never
        His covenant remove;
        His name shall stand forever, --
        That name to us is Love.

        1. Hark, a thrilling voice is sounding!
        1. Hark, a thrilling voice is sounding!
        "Christ is nigh!" we hear it say;
        "Cast away the works of darkness,
        O ye children of the day!"

        2. Startled at the solemn warning,
        Let the earth-bound soul arise;
        Christ, her Sun, all sloth dispelling,
        Shines upon the morning skies.

        3. Lo, the Lamb, so long expected,
        Comes with pardon down from heaven.
        Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
        One and all, to be forgiven,

        4. That, when next He comes with glory
        And the world is wrapped in fear,
        He may shield us with His mercy
        And with words of love draw near.

        5. Honor, glory, might, dominion,
        To the Father and the Son,
        With the everlasting Spirit,
        While eternal ages run!

        1. Comfort, comfort, ye My people,
        1. Comfort, comfort, ye My people,
        Speak ye peace, thus saith our God;
        Comfort those who sit in darkness,
        Mourning 'neath their sorrows load.
        Speak ye to Jerusalem
        Of the peace that waits for them;
        Tell her that her sins I cover
        And her warfare now is over.

        2. Yea, her sins our God will pardon,
        Blotting out each dark misdeed;
        All that well deserved His anger
        He no more will see or heed.
        She hath suffered many a day,
        Now her griefs have passed away;
        God will change her pining sadness
        Into ever-springing gladness.

        3. Hark, the Herald's voice is crying
        In the desert far and near,
        Bidding all men to repentance
        Since the Kingdom now is here.
        Oh, that warning cry obey!
        Now prepare for God a way;
        Let the valleys rise to meet Him
        And the hills bow down to greet Him.

        4. Make ye straight what long was crooked,
        Make the rougher places plain;
        Let your hearts be true and humble,
        As befits His holy reign.
        For the glory of the Lord
        Now o'er earth is shed abroad,
        And all flesh shall see the token
        That His Word is never broken.

        1. Oh, come, Oh, come, Emmanuel,
        1. Oh, come, Oh, come, Emmanuel,
        And ransom captive Israel
        That mourns in lonely exile here
        Until the Son of God appear.
        Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
        Shall come to thee, O Israel.

        2. Oh, come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
        Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
        From depths of hell Thy people save
        And give them victory o'er the grave.
        Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
        Shall come to thee, O Israel.

        3. Oh, come, Thou Dayspring from on high,
        And cheer us by Thy drawing nigh;
        Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
        And death's dark shadows put to flight.
        Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
        Shall come to thee, O Israel.

        4. Oh, come, Thou Key of David, come
        And open wide our heavenly home:
        Make safe the way that leads on high
        And close the path to misery.
        Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
        Shall come to thee, O Israel.

        1. On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
        1. On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
        Announces that the Lord is nigh;
        Come, then, and hearken, for he brings
        Glad tidings from the King of kings.

        2. Then cleansed by every Christian breast
        And furnished for so great a Guest.
        Yea, let us each our hearts prepare
        For Christ to come and enter there.

        3. For Thou art our Salvation, Lord,
        Our Refuge, and our great Reward.
        Without Thy grace our souls must fade
        And wither like a flower decayed.

        4. Lay on the sick Thy healing hand
        And make the fallen strong to stand;
        Show us the glory of Thy face
        Till beauty springs in every place.

        5. All praise, eternal Son, to Thee
        Who advent sets Thy people free,
        Whom, with the Father, we adore
        And Holy Ghost forevermore.

        1. Jesus, Thy Church with longing eyes
        1. Jesus, Thy Church with longing eyes
        For Thine expected coming waits.
        When will the promised light arise
        And glory beam from Zion's gates?

        2. E'en now, when tempests round us fall
        And wintry clouds o'ercast the sky,
        Thy words with pleasure we recall
        And deem that our redemption's nigh.

        3. Come, gracious Lord, our hearts renew,
        Our foes repel, our wrongs redress,
        Man's rooted enmity subdue,
        And crown Thy Gospel with success.

        4. Oh, come and reign o'er every land;
        Let Satan from his throne be hurled,
        All nations bow to Thy command,
        And grace revive a dying world.

        5. Teach us in watchfulness and prayer
        To wait for the appointed hour
        And fit us by Thy grace to share
        The triumphs of Thy conquering power.

        1. When sinners see their lost condition
        1. When sinners see their lost condition
        And feel the pressing load of sin
        And Jesus cometh on His mission
        To heal the sin-sick heart within,
        All grief must flee before His grace,
        And joy divine will take its place.

        2. When Jesus enters meek and lowly
        To fill the home with sweetest peace;
        When hearts have felt His blessing holy
        And found from sin complete release,
        Then light and calm within shall reign
        And hearts divided love again.

        3. When Jesus enters land and nation
        And moves the people with His love;
        When, yielding to His kind persuasion,
        Our hearts His truth and blessing prove,
        Then shall our life on earth be blest,
        The peace of God on us shall rest.

        4. When Jesus comes, --O blessed story!--
        He works a change in heart and life;
        God's kingdom comes with power and glory
        To young and old, to man and wife;
        Through Sacrament and living Word
        Faith, love, and hope are now conferred.

        5. Then stilled are cries and lamentation,
        Then loosed is Satan's every band,
        In death is hope and consolation,
        The soul is safe in Jesus hand.
        When we shall walk through death's dark vale,
        His rod and staff shall never fail.

        6. Oh, may He soon to every nation
        Find entrance where He is unknown,
        With life and light and full salvation,
        That heathendom may be o'erthrown
        And healing to the hearts may come
        In heathen land and Christian home!

        1. Hark the glad sound! The Savior comes,
        1. Hark the glad sound! The Savior comes,
        The Savior promised long;
        Let every heart prepare a throne
        And every voice a song.

        2. He comes the prisoners to release,
        In Satan's bondage held.
        The gates of brass before Him burst,
        The iron fetters yield.

        3. He comes from thickest films of vice
        To clear the mental ray
        And on the eyeballs of the blind
        To pour celestial day.

        4. He comes the broken heart to bind,
        The bleeding soul to cure,
        And with the treasures of His grace
        To enrich the humble poor.

        5. Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
        Thy welcome shall proclaim
        And heaven's eternal arches ring
        With Thy beloved name.

        1. The Bridegroom soon will call us:
        1. The Bridegroom soon will call us:
        Come, all ye wedding-guests!
        May not His voice appal us
        While slumber binds our breasts!
        May all our lamps be burning
        And oil be found in store
        That we, with Him returning,
        May open find the door!

        2. There shall we see delighted
        Our dear Redeemer's face,
        Who leads our souls benighted
        To glory by His grace.
        The patriarchs shall meet us,
        The prophets holy band,
        Apostles, martyrs, greet us
        In that celestial land.

        3. They will not blush to own us
        As brothers, sisters dear;
        Love ever will be shown us
        When we with them appear.
        We all shall come before Him
        Who for us man became,
        As Lord and God adore Him,
        And ever bless His name.

        4. Our Father, rich in blessing,
        Will give us crowns of gold
        And, to His bosom pressing,
        Impart a bliss untold,
        Will welcome with embraces
        Of never-ending love,
        And deck us with His graces
        In blissful realms above.

        5. In yonder home shall never
        Be silent music's voice;
        With hearts and lips forever
        We shall in God rejoice.
        The angels shall adore Him,
        All saints shall sing His praise
        And bring with joy before Him
        Their sweetest heavenly lays.

        6. In mansions fair and spacious
        Will God the feast prepare
        And, ever kind and gracious,
        Bid us its riches share.
        There bliss that knows no measure
        From springs of love shall flow,
        And never-changing pleasure
        His bounty will bestow.

        7. Thus God shall from all evil
        Forever make us free,
        From sin and from the devil,
        From all adversity,
        From sickness, pain, and sadness,
        From troubles, cares, and fears,
        And grant us heavenly gladness
        And wipe away our tears.

        1. The advent of our King
        1. The advent of our King
        Our prayers must now employ,
        And we must hymns of welcome sing
        In strains of holy joy.

        2. The everlasting Son
        Incarnate deigns to be;
        Himself a servant's form puts on
        To set His servants free.

        3. O Zion's Daughter, rise
        To meet thy lowly King,
        Nor let thy faithless heart despise
        The peace He comes to bring.

        4. As Judge, on clouds of light,
        He soon will come again
        And His true members all unite
        With Him in heaven to reign.

        5. Before the dawning day
        Let sin's dark deeds be gone,
        The old man all be put away,
        The new man all put on.

        6. All glory to the Son,
        Who comes to set us free,
        With Father, Spirit, ever One,
        Through all eternity.

        1. Arise, sons of the Kingdom!
        1. Arise, sons of the Kingdom!
        The King is drawing nigh;
        Arise and hail with gladness
        The Ruler from on high.
        Ye Christians, hasten forth!
        Your praise and homage bring Him
        And glad hosannas sing Him;
        Naught else your love is worth.

        2. Arise, ye drooping mourners!
        The King is very near;
        Away with grief and sorrow!
        For, lo, your Help is here.
        Behold, in many a place --
        Oh, blessed consolation! --
        You find Him, your Salvation,
        Within His means of grace.

        3. Arise, ye much afflicted!
        The King is not afar.
        Rejoice, ye long dejected,
        Behold the Morning Star!
        The Lord will give you joy;
        Though troubles now distress you,
        With comfort He will bless you,
        E'en death will He destroy.

        4. Arise, ye poor and needy!
        The King provides for you;
        He comes with succor speedy,
        With mercy ever new.
        Receive your gracious King,
        The Giver of all blessing,
        Hail Him, His name confessing,
        And glad hosannas sing.

        5. Be righteous, ye his subjects,
        The King is just and true;
        Prepare for Him a highway,
        Make all things straight and new.
        For, lo, He means it well;
        Then willing bear the crosses
        That He Himself imposes,
        Nor let your courage fail.

        6. Oh, rich the gifts Thou bringest,
        Thyself made poor and weak!
        O Love beyond expression,
        That thus can sinners seek!
        For this, O Lord, will we
        Our joyous tribute bring Thee
        And glad hosannas sing Thee
        And ever grateful be.

        1. Hosanna to the living Lord!
        1. Hosanna to the living Lord!
        Hosanna to the Incarnate Word!
        To Christ, Creator, Savior, King,
        Let earth, let heaven, hosanna sing.

        2. O Savior, with protecting care
        Abide in this Thy house of prayer,
        Where we Thy parting promise claim,
        Assembled in Thy sacred name.

        3. But, chiefest, in our cleansed breast,
        Eternal, bid Thy Spirit rest
        And make our secret soul to be
        A temple pure and worthy Thee.

        4. So in the last and dreadful Day,
        When earth and heaven shall melt away,
        Thy flock, redeemed from sinful stain,
        Shall swell the sound of praise again.

        1. Watchman, tell us of the night,
        1. Watchman, tell us of the night,
        What its signs of promise are.
        Traveler, o'er yon mountain's height,
        See that glory-beaming star.
        Watchman, doth its beauteous ray
        Aught of joy or hope foretell?
        Traveler, yes; it brings the day,
        Promised day of Israel.

        2. Watchman, tell us of the night;
        Hiher yet that star ascends.
        Traveler, blessedness and light,
        Peace and truth, its course portends.
        Watchman, will its beams alone
        Gild the spot that gave them birth?
        Traveler, ages are its own;
        See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

        3. Watchman, tell us of the night,
        For the morning seems to dawn.
        Traveler, darkness takes its flight;
        Doubt and terror are withdrawn.
        Watchman, let thy wanderings cease;
        Hie thee to thy quiet home.
        Traveler, lo, the Prince of Peace,
        Lo, the Son of God, is come!

        1. Rejoice, rejoice, believers,
        1. Rejoice, rejoice, believers,
        And let your lights appear!
        The evening is advancing,
        And darker night is near.
        The Bridegroom is arising,
        And soon He draweth nigh;
        Up, pray and watch and wrestle!
        At midnight comes the cry.

        2. The watchers on the mountain
        Proclaim the Bridegroom near;
        Go meet Him as He cometh,
        With hallelujahs clear.
        The marriage-feast is waiting,
        The gates wide open stand;
        Up, up, ye heirs of glory;
        The Bridegroom is at hand!

        3. Ye saints, who here in patience
        Your cross and sufferings bore,
        Shall live and reign forever,
        When sorrow is no more.
        Around the throne of glory
        The Lamb ye shall behold;
        In triumph cast before Him
        Your diadems of gold!

        4. Our Hope and Expectation,
        O Jesus, now appear;
        Arise, Desire of nations,
        O'er this benighted sphere.
        With hearts and hands uplifted,
        We plead, O Lord, to see
        The day of earth's redemption,
        That brings us unto Thee!

        1. Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
        1. Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
        Behold, the King of Glory waits;
        The King of kings is drawing near,
        The Savior of the world is here.
        Life and salvation He doth bring,
        Wherefore rejoice and gladly sing:
        We praise Thee, Father, now,
        Creator, wise art Thou!

        2. A Helper just He comes to thee,
        His chariot is humility,
        His kingly crown is holiness,
        His scepter, pity in distress,
        The end of all our woe He brings;
        Wherefore the earth is glad and sings:
        We praise Thee, Savior, now,
        Mighty in deed art Thou!

        3. O blest the land, the city blest,
        Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
        O happy hearts and happy homes
        To whom this King in triumph comes!
        The cloudless Sun of joy He is,
        Who bringeth pure delight and bliss.
        We praise Thee, Spirit, now,
        Our Comforter art Thou!

        4. Fling wide the portals of your heart;
        Make it a temple set apart
        From earthly use for Heaven's employ,
        Adorned with prayer and love and joy.
        So shall your Sovereign enter in
        And new and nobler life begin.
        To Thee, O God, be praise
        For word and deed and grace!

        5. Redeemer, come! I open wide
        My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide!
        Let me Thy inner presence feel,
        Thy grace and love in me reveal;
        Thy Holy Spirit guide us on
        Until our glorious goal is won.
        Eternal praise and fame
        We offer to Thy name.

        1. Once He came in blessing,
        1. Once He came in blessing,
        All our ills redressing;
        Came in likeness lowly,
        Son of God most holy;
        Bore the cross to save us,
        Hope and freedom gave us.

        2. Still He comes within us,
        Still His voice would win us
        From the sins that hurt us;
        Would to Truth convert us
        From our foolish errors
        Ere He comes in terrors.

        3. Thus, if thou hast known Him,
        Not ashamed to own Him,
        But wilt trust Him boldly
        Nor dost love Him coldly,
        He will then receive thee,
        Heal thee, and forgive thee.

        4. He who thus endureth
        Bright reward secureth.
        Come, then, O Lord Jesus,
        From our sins release us;
        Let us here confess Thee
        Till in heaven we bless Thee.

        1. Ye sons of men, oh, hearken:
        1. Ye sons of men, oh, hearken:
        Your heart and mind prepare,
        To hail the almighty Savior,
        O sinners, be your care.
        He who of grace alone
        Our Life and Light was given,
        The promised Lord from heaven,
        Unto our world is shown.

        2. Prepare the way before Him;
        Prepare for Him the best,
        Cast out whate'er offendeth
        This great, this heavenly Guest
        Make straight, make plain, the way:
        The lowly valleys raising
        The heights of pride abasing.
        His path all even lay.

        3. The humble heart and lowly
        God lifteth up on high:
        Beneath His feet in anguish
        The haughty soul shall lie.
        The heart, sincere and right,
        That heeds God's invitation
        And makes true preparation,
        It is the Lord's delight.

        4. Prepare my heart, Lord Jesus,
        Turn not from me aside,
        And grand that I receive Thee
        This blessed Advent-tide.
        From stall and manger low
        Come Thou to dwell within me;
        Loud praises will I sing Thee
        And forth glory show.

	With virgin honor purel
	Repeat the hymn again:
	"To God on high be glory

	2. The Word becomes incarnate
	And yet remains on high,
	And cherubim sing anthems
	To shepherds from the sky.
	Repeat the hymn again:
	"To God on high be glory
	And peace on earth to men!"

	3. While thus they sing your Monarch,
	Those bright angelic bands,
	Rejoice, ye vales and mountains,
	Ye oceans, clap your hands.
	Repeat the hymn again:
	"To God on high be glory
	And peace on earth to men!"

        1. All my heart this night rejoices
        1. All my heart this night rejoices
        As I hear Far and near
        Sweetest angel voices.
        "Christ is born," their choirs are singing
        Till the air Everywhere
        Now with joy is ringing.

        2. Forth today the Conqueror goeth,
        Who the foe, Sin and woe,
        Death and hell, o'erthroweth.
        God is man, man to deliver;
        His dear Son Now is one
        With our blood forever.

        3. Shall we still dread God's displeasure,
        Who, to save, Freely gave
        His most cherished Treasure?
        To redeem us, He hath given
        His own Son From the throne
        Of His might in heaven.

        4. Should He who Himself imparted
        Aught withhold From the fold,
        Leave us broken-hearted?
        Should the Son of God not love us,
        Who, to cheer Sufferers here,
        Left His throne above us?

        5. If our blessed Lord and Maker
        Hated men, Would He then
        Be of flesh partaker?
        If He in our woe delighted,
        Would He bear All the care
        Of our race benighted?

        6. He becomes the Lamb that taketh
        Sin away And for aye
        Full atonement maketh.
        For our life His own He tenders
        And our race, By His grace,
        Meet for glory renders.

        7. Hark! a voice from yonder manger,
        Soft and sweet, Doth entreat:
        "Flee from woe and danger.
        Brethren, from all ills that grieve you
        You are feed; All you need
        I will surely give you."

        8. Come, then, banish all your sadness,
        One and all, Great and small;
        Come with songs of gladness.
        Love Him who with love is glowing;
        Hail the Star, Near and far
        Light and joy bestowing.

        9. Ye whose anguish knew no measure,
        Weep no more; See the door
        To celestial pleasure.
        Cling to Him, for He will guide you
        Where no cross, Pain, or loss
        Can again betide you.

        10. Hither come, ye heavy-hearted,
        Who for sin, Deep within,
        Long and sore have smarted;
        For the poisoned wound you're feeling
        Help is near, One is here
        Mighty for their healing.

        11. Hither come, ye poor and wretched;
        11. Hither come, ye poor and wretched;
        Know His will Is to fill
        Every hand outstretched.
        Here are riches without measure;
        Here forget All regret,
        Fill your hearts with treasure.

        12. Let me in my arms receive Thee;
        On Thy breast Let me rest,
        Savior, ne'er to leave Thee.
        Since Thou hast Thyself presented
        Now to me, I shall be
        Evermore contented.

        13. Guilt no longer can distress me;
        Son of God, Thou my load
        Bearest to release me.
        Stain in me Thou findest never;
        I am clean, All my sin
        Is removed forever.

        14. I am pure, in Thee believing,
        From Thy store Evermore
        Righteous robes receiving.
        In my heart I will enfold Thee,
        Treasure rare, Let me there,
        Loving, ever hold Thee.

        15. Dearest Lord, Thee will I cherish.
        Though my breath Fail in death,
        Yet I shall not perish,
        But with Thee abide forever
        There on high, In that joy
        Which can vanish never.

        1. Rejoice, rejoice, this happy morn,
        1. Rejoice, rejoice, this happy morn,
        A Savior unto us is born,
        The Christ, the Lord of Glory.
        His lowly birth in Bethlehem
        The angels from on high proclaim
        And sing redemption's story.

        Dost take a manger for Thy throne,
        While worlds on worlds are Thine alone.
        Hallelujah!

        2. Once did the skies before Thee bow;
        A virgin's arms contain Thee now,
        While angels, who in Thee rejoice,
        Now listen for Thine infant voice.
        Hallelujah!

        3. A little Child, Thou art our Guest
        That weary ones in Thee may rest;
        Forlorn and lowly is Thy birth
        That we may rise to heaven from earth.
        Hallelujah!

        4. Thou comest in the darksome night
        To make us children of the light,
        To make us in the realms divine,
        Like Thine own angels, round Thee shine.
        Hallelujah!

        5. All this for us Thy love hath done;
        By This to Thee our love is won;
        For this our joyful songs we raise
        And shout our thanks in ceaseless praise.
        Hallelujah!

        1. O Jesus Christ,
        1. O Jesus Christ,
        Thy manger is
        My paradise at which my soul reclineth.
        For there, O Lord,
        Doth lie the Word
        Made flesh for us; herein Thy grace
        forthshineth.

        2. He whom the sea
        And wind obey
        Doth come to serve the sinner in great
        meekness.
        Thou, God's own Son,
        With us art one,
        Dost join us and our children in our
        weekness.

        3. Thy light and grace
        Our guilt efface,
        Thy heavenly riches all our loss
        retrieving.
        Immanuel,
        Thy birth doth quell
        The power of hell and Satan's bold
        deceiving.

        4. Thou Christian heart,
        Whoe'er thou art,
        Be of good cheer and let no sorrow move
        thee!
        For God's own Child,
        In mercy mild,
        Joins thee to Him;-how greatly God must
        love thee!

        5. Remember thou
        What glory now
        The Lord prepared thee for all earthly
        sadness.
        The angel host
        Can never boast
        Of greater glory, greater bliss or gladness.

        6. The world may hold
        Her wealth and gold;
        But thou, my heart, keep Christ as thy true
        Treasure.
        To Him hold fast
        Until at last
        A crown be thine and honor in full
        measure.

        1. Come rejoicing, Praises voicing,
        1. Come rejoicing, Praises voicing,
        Christmas Day is breaking;
        Now the Eternal, Lord supernal,
        Human form is taking.
        On the hay--lo, behold
        Virgin's Son, as foretold--
        Lies the precious Infant in the wintry cold.

        2. Unabated, For Him waited
        Many generations;
        Him now proudly Angels loudly
        Praise the Hope of nations.
        Let us, then, gladly sing,
        Let our songs daily ring
        As we to this holy Child our praises bring.

        3. Tender Flower, Mighty Tower,
        Jesus Christ, our Savior;
        Heavenly Treasure, Without measure
        Thee we love forever.
        Lord and King without end,
        Our poor hearts now befriend,
        All Thy gifts of grace and goodness to us send.

        1. Hark! what mean those holy voices
        1. Hark! what mean those holy voices
        Sweetly sounding through the skies?
        Lo, the angelic host rejoices,
        Heavenly hallelujahs rise.

        2. Listen to the wondrous story
        Which they chant in hymns of joy,
        Glory in the highest, glory!
        Glory be to God most high!

        3. Peace on earth, good will from heaven,
        Reaching far as man is found;
        Souls redeemed and sins forgiven!
        Loud our golden harps shall sound.

        4. Christ is born, the great Anointed;
        Heaven and earth, His praises sing!
        Oh, receive whom God appointed
        For your Prophet, Priest, and King.

        5. Hasten, mortals, to adore Him,
        Learn His name and taste His joy,
        Till in heaven ye sing before Him,
        "Glory be to God most high!"

        6. Let us learn the wondrous story
        Of our great Redeemer's birth;
        Spread the brightness of His glory
        Till it cover all the earth.

        1. Christians, awake, salute the happy morn
        1. Christians, awake, salute the happy morn
        Whereon the Savior of the world was born.
        Rise to adore the mystery of love
        Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
        With them the joyful tidings first begun
        Of God Incarnate and the Virgin's Son.

        2. Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
        Who heard the angelic herald's voice, "Behold,
        I bring good tidings of a Savior's birth
        To you and all the nations upon earth;
        This day hath God fulfilled His promised word;
        This day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord."

        3. He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
        In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;
        The praises of redeeming love they sang,
        And heaven's whole orb with alleluias rang.
        God's highest glory was their anthem still,
        Peace upon earth, and unto men good will.

        4. To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran
        To see the wonder God had wrought for man
        And found, with Joseph and the blessed maid,
        Her Son, the Savior, in a manger laid;
        Then to their flocks, still praising God, return.
        And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn.

        5. Oh, may we keep and ponder in our mind
        God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind!
        Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,
        From His poor manger to His bitter cross,
        Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
        Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.

        6.Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
        To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song.
        He that was born upon this joyful day
        Around us all His glory shall display.
        Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
        Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.

        1. "From heaven above to earth I come
        1. "From heaven above to earth I come
        To bear good news to every home;
        Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
        Whereof I now will say and sing:

        2. "To you this night is born a child
        Of Mary, chosen virgin mild;
        This little child, of lowly birth,
        Shall be the joy of all the earth.

        3. "This is the Christ, our God and Lord,
        Who in all need shall aid afford;
        He will Himself your Savior be
        From all your sins to set you free.

        4. "He will on you the gifts bestow
        Prepared by God for all below,
        That in His kingdom, bright and fair,
        You may with us His glory share.

        5. "These are the tokens ye shall mark:
        The swaddling-clothes and manger dark;
        There ye shall find the Infant laid
        By whom the heavens and earth were made."

        6. Now let us all with gladsome cheer
        Go with the shepherds and draw near
        To see the precious gift of God,
        Who hath His own dear Son bestowed.

        7. Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!
        What is it in yon manger lies?
        Who is this child, so young and fair?
        The blessed Christ-child lieth there.

        8. Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,
        Through whom the sinful world is blest!
        Thou com'st to share my misery;
        What thanks shall I return to Thee?

        9. Ah, Lord, who hast created all,
        How weak art Thou, how poor and small,
        That Thou dost choose Thine infant bed
        Where humble cattle lately fed!

        10. Were earth a thousand times as fair,
        Beset with gold and jewels rare,
        It yet were far too poor to be
        A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.

        11. For velvets soft and silken stuff
        11. For velvets soft and silken stuff
        Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,
        Whereon Thou, King, so rich and great,
        As 'twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.

        12. And thus, dear Lord, it pleaseth Thee
        To make this truth quite plain to me,
        That all the world's wealth, honor, might,
        Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.

        13. Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
        Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
        Within my heart, that it may be
        A quiet chamber kept for Thee.

        14. My heart for very joy doth leap,
        My lips no more can silence keep;
        I, too, must sing with joyful tongue
        That sweetest ancient cradle-song:

        15. Glory to God in highest heaven,
        Who unto us His Son hath given!
        While angels sing with pious mirth
        A glad new year to all the earth.

        1. Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
        1. Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
        Let earth receive her King;
        Let every heart prepare Him room
        And heaven and nature sing.

        2. Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
        Let men their songs employ,
        While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
        Repeat the sounding joy.

        3. No more let sins and sorrows grow
        Nor thorns infest the ground;
        He comes to make His blessings flow
        Far as the curse is found.

        4. He rules the world with truth and grace
        And makes the nations prove
        The glories of His righteousness
        And wonders of His love.

        1. This night a wondous revelation
        1. This night a wondous revelation
        Makes known to me God's love and grace;
        The Child that merits adoration
        Brings light to our benighted race;
        And though a thousand suns did shine,
        Still brighter were that Light divine.

        2. The Sun of Grace for thee is beaming;
        Rejoice, my soul, in Jesus birth!
        The light from yonder manger streaming
        Sends forth its rays o'er all the earth.
        It drives the night of sin away
        And turns our darkness into day.

        3. This light, which all thy gloom can banish,
        The bliss of  heaven  glorifies;
        When sun and moon and stars shall vanish,
        Its rays shall still illume the skies.
        This light  through  all  eternity
        Thy heaven and all to thee shall be.

        4. 0 Jesus, precious Sun of Gladness,
        Fill Thou-my soul with light, I pray.
        Dispel the gloomy night of sadness
        And teach Thou me this Christmas Day
        How I a child of light may be,
        Aglow with light that comes from Thee.

        1. To Thee my heart I offer,
        1. To Thee my heart I offer,
        0 Christ-child sweet and dear;
        Upon Thy love relying,
        Oh, be Thou ever near!
        Take Thou my heart and give me Thine
        And let it be forever mine,
        0 Jesus, holy, undefiled,
        My Savior meek and mild.

        2. My heart within is glowing,
        0 Christ-child sweet and dear.
        I love Thee, Lord and Savior;
        Oh, be Thou ever near!
        I see Thee in a manger laid,
        Near cattle resting unafraid;
        I see Thy deep humility
        And lowly bow to Thee.

        3. What brought Thee to the manger,
        0 Christ-child sweet and dear?
        Thy love for me, a stranger, --
        Oh, be Thou ever near!
        0 Lord, how great is this Thy love
        That reaches down from heaven above,
        Thy love for us, by sin defiled,
        That made Thee, God, a child!

        4. With all my heart and being,
        0 Christ-child sweet and dear,
        I love Thee, and Thee only;
        Oh, be Thou ever near!
        My heart I in Thy manger lay,
        Let it remain there and for aye
        Draw it to Thee that it may be
        Secure eternally.

        5. Let me be Thine forever,
        0 Christ-child sweet and dear;
        Uphold me with Thy mercy
        And be Thou ever near.
        From Thee I gladly all receive,
        And what is mine to Thee I give.
        My heart, my soul, and all I own:
        Let these be Thine alone.

        1. Come, your hearts and voices raising,
        1. Come, your hearts and voices raising,
        Christ the Lord with gladness praising;
        Loudly sing His love amazing,
        Worthy folk of Christendom.

        2. Sin and death may well be groaning,
        Satan now may well be moaning;
        We, our full salvation owning,
        Cast our every care away.

        3. See how God, for us providing,
        Gave His Son and life abiding;
        He our weary steps is guiding
        From earth's woe to heavenly joy.

        4. Christ, from heaven to us descending
        And in love our race befriending,
        In our need His help extending,
        Saved us from the wily Foe.

        5. Jacob's Star in all its splendor
        Beams with comfort sweet and tender,
        Forcing Satan to surrender,
        Breaking all the powers of hell.

        6. From the bondage that oppressed us,
        From sin's fetters that possessed us,
        From the grief that sore distressed us,
        We, the captives, now are free.

        7. Oh, the joy beyond expressing
        When by faith we grasp this blessing
        And to Thee we come confessing,
        That our freedom thou hast wrought!

        8. Gracious Child, we pray Thee, hear us,
        From Thy lowly manger cheer us,
        Gently lead us and be near us
        Till we join the angelic choir.

        1. Let the earth now praise the Lord.
        1. Let the earth now praise the Lord.
        Who hath truly kept His word
        And the sinners Help and Friend
        Now at last to us doth send.

        2. What the fathers most desired,
        What the prophets heart inspired,
        What they longed for many a year,
        Stands fulfilled in glory here.

        3. Abrams promised great Reward,
        Zion's Helper, Jacob's Lord, --
        Him of twofold race behold, --
        Truly came, as long foretold.

        4. Welcome, 0 my Savior, now!
        Hail! My Portion, Lord, art Thou.
        Here, too, in my heart, I pray,
        Oh, prepare Thyself a way!

        5. King of Glory, enter in;
        Cleanse it from the filth of sin,
        As Thou hast so often done;
        It belongs to Thee alone.

        6. As Thy coming was in peace,
        Quiet, full of gentleness,
        Let the same mind dwell in me
        That was ever found in Thee.

        7. Comfort my desponding heart:
        Thou my Strength and Refuge art.
        I am weak, and cunningly
        Satan lays his snares for me.

        8. Bruise for me the Serpent's head,
        That, set free from doubt and dread,
        I may cleave to Thee in faith,
        Safely kept through life and death,

        9. And when Thou dost come again
        As a glorious King to reign,
        I with joy may see Thy face,
        Freely ransomed by Thy grace.

        1. Now sing we, now rejoice,
        1. Now sing we, now rejoice,
        Now raise to heaven our voice;
        He from whom joy streameth
        Poor in a manger lies;
        Not so brightly beameth
        The sun in yonder skies.
        Thou my Savior art!
        Thou my Savior art!

        2. Come from on high to me;
        I cannot rise to Thee
        Cheer my wearied spirit,
        O pure and holy Child;
        Through Thy grace and merit,
        Blest Jesus, Lord most mild,
        Draw me unto Thee!
        Draw me unto Thee!

        3. Now through His Son doth shine
        The Father's grace divine.
        Death o'er us had reigned
        Through sin and vanity;
        He for us obtained
        Eternal joy on high.
        May we praise Him there!
        May we praise Him there!

        4. Oh, where shall joy be found?
        Where but on heavenly ground?
        Where the angels singing
        With all His saints unite,
        Sweetest praises bringing
        In heavenly joy and light.
        Oh, that we were there!
        Oh, that we were there!

        1. O Lord, we welcome Thee,
        1. O Lord, we welcome Thee,
        Our hearts for joy are leaping.
        Thou, Jesus, dearest Child,
        Thy precious promise keeping,
        Art come from heaven to earth
        To be our Brother dear;
        Thou gracious Son of God,
        Wilt banish all our fear.

        2. The mighty Son of God,
        His majesty concealing,
        Dwells with our fallen race
        To give us balm and healing.
        The everlasting God
        Descends from realms above,
        Becomes a winsome Child,
        Reveals His Father's love.

        3. Ah, sweet and gentle name!
        Its echoes far are sounding,
        It pierces hearts of stone
        And tells of love abounding.
        O Jesus, dearest Child,
        On Thee will we rely,
        And, calling on Thy name,
        We die not when we die.

        4. To Thee alone we cling,
        For Thee all else forsaking;
        On Thee alone we build
        Though heaven and earth be quaking.
        To Thee alone we live,
        In Thee alone we die;
        O Jesus, dearest Lord,
        With Thee we reign on high.

        1. Hark! the herald angels sing,
        1. Hark! the herald angels sing,

        "Glory to the new-born King!"

        2. Christ, by highest heaven adored.

        Pleased as Man with man to dwell;
        Jesus, our Immanuel!
        Hark! the herald angels sing,
        "Glory to the new-born King!"

        3. HaiI, the heavenly Prince of Peace!
        Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!

        Risen with healing in His wings.
        Mild He leaves His throne on high,
        Born that man no more may die;
        Born to raise the sons of earth;
        Born to give them second birth.
        Hark! the herald angels sing,
        "Glory to the new-born King!"

        4. Come, Desire of nations, come,

        Formed in each believing heart!
        Hark! the herald angels sing,

        Peace on earth and mercy mild,
        God and sinners reconciled!"

        "Glory to the new-born King!"

        1. Savior of the nations, come,
        1. Savior of the nations, come,
        Virgin's Son, make here Thy home!
        Marvel now, O heaven and earth,
        That the Lord chose such a birth.

        2. Not by human flesh and blood,
        By the Spirit of our God,
        Was the Word of God made flesh--
        Woman's Offspring, pure and fresh.

        3. Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child
        Of the Virgin undefiled!
        Though by all the world disowned,
        Still to be in heaven enthroned.

        4. From the Father forth He came
        And returneth to the same,
        Captive leading death and hell--
        High the song of triumph swell!

        5. Thou, the Father's only Son,
        Hast o'er sin the victory won.
        Boundless shall Thy kingdom be;
        When shall we its glories see?

        6. Brightly doth Thy manger shine,
        Glorious is its light divine.
        Let not sin o'ercloud this light;
        Ever be our faith thus bright.

        7. Praise to God the Father sing,
        Praise to God the Son, our King,
        Praise to God the Spirit be
        Ever and eteranally.

        1. Oh, rejoice, ye Christians, loudly,

        For our joy hath now begun;
        Wondrous things our God hath done.

        Who our race hath honored thus
        That He deigns to dwell with us.
        Joy 0 joy, beyond all gladness,
        Christ hath done away with sadness!
        Hence, all sorrow and repining,
        For the Sun of Grace is shining!

        2. See, my soul, thy Savior chooses
        Weakness here and poverty;
        In such love He comes to thee
        Nor the hardest couch refuses;
        All He suffers for thy good,
        To redeem thee by His blood.
        Joy, 0 joy, beyond all gladness,
        Christ hath done away with sadness!

        3. Lord, how shall I thank Thee rightly?
        I acknowledge that by Thee
        I am saved eternally.
        Let me not forget it lightly,
        But to Thee at All times cleave
        And my heart true peace receive.
        Joy, 0 joy, beyond all gladness,
        Christ hath done away with sadness!
        Hence, all sorrow and repining,
        For the Sun of Grace is shining!

        4. Jesus, guard and guide Thy members,
        Fill Thy brethren with Thy grace,
        Hear their prayers in every place.
        Quicken now life's faintest embers;
        Grant all Christians, far and near,
        Holy peace, a glad New Year!
        Joy, 0 joy, beyond all gladness,
        Christ hath done away with sadness!

        1. Let us all with gladsome voice
        1. Let us all with gladsome voice
        Praise the God of heaven,
        Who, to bid our hearts rejoice,
        His own Son hath given.

        2. To this vale of tears He comes,
        Here to serve in sadness,
        That with Him in heaven's fair homes
        We may reign in gladness.

        3. We are rich, for He was poor;
        Is not this a wonder?
        Therefore praise God evermore
        Here on earth and yonder.

        4. 0 Lord Christ, our Savior dear,
        Be Thou ever near us.
        Grant us now a glad new year.
        Amen, Jesus, hear us!

        1. Of the Father's love begotten
        1. Of the Father's love begotten
        Ere the worlds began to be,
        He is Alpha and Omega,
        He the Source, the Ending He,
        Of the things that are, that have been,
        And that future years shall see
        Evermore and evermore.

        2. Oh, that birth forever blessed
        When the Virgin, full of grace,
        By the Holy Ghost conceiving,
        Bare the Savior of our race,
        And the Babe, the world's Redeemer,
        First revealed His sacred face
        Evermore and evermore.

        3. O ye heights of heaven, adore Him;
        Angel hosts, His praises sing;
        Powers, dominions, bow before Him
        And extol our God and King.
        Let no tongue on earth be silent,
        Every voice in concert ring
        Evermore and evermore.

        4. This is He whom Heaven-taught singers
        Sang of old with one accord;
        Whom the Scriptures of the prophets
        Promised in their faithful word.
        Now He shines, the Long-expected;
        Let creation praise its Lord
        Evermore and evermore.

        5. Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,
        And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee
        Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving
        And unending praises be,
        Honor, glory, and dominion,
        And eternal victory
        Evermore and evermore.

        1. Now are the days fulfilled,
        1. Now are the days fulfilled,
        God's Son is manifested,
        Now His great majesty
        In human flesh is vested.
        Behold the mighty God,
        By whom all wrath is stilled,
        The woman's promised Seed -
        Now are the days fulfilled.

        2. Now are the days fulfilled,
        Lo, Jacob's Star is shining;
        The gloomy night has fled
        Wherein the world lay pining.
        Now, IsraeI, look on Him
        Who long thy heart hath thrilled;
        Hear Zion's watchmen cry:
        Now are the days fulfilled.

        3. Now are the days fulfilled,
        The child of God rejoices;
        No bondage of the Law,
        No curses that it voices,
        Can fill our hearts with fear;
        On Christ our hope we build.
        Behold the Prince of Peace--
        Now are the days fulfilled.

        1. Christians, sing out with exultation
        1. Christians, sing out with exultation
        And praise your Benefactor's name!
        Today the Author of salvation,
        The Father's Well-beloved, came.
        Of undefiled virgin mother
        An Infant, all divine, was born,
        And God Himself became your Brother
        Upon this happy Christmas morn.

        2. In Him eternal might and power
        To human weakness hath inclined;
        And this poor Child brings richest dower
        Of gifts and graces to mankind.
        While here His majesty disguising,
        A servant's form the Master wears,
        Behold the beams of glory rising
        E'en from His poverty and tears.

        3. A stable serves Him for a dwelling
        And for a bed a manger mean;
        Yet o'er His head, His advent telling,
        A new and wondrous star is seen.
        Angels rehearse to men the story,
        The joyful story, of His birth;
        To Him they raise the anthem -- "Glory
        To God on high and peace on earth!"

        4. For through this holy incarnation
        The primal curse is done away;
        And blessed peace o'er all creation
        Hath shed its pure and gentle ray.
        Then, in that heavenly concert joining,
        0 Christian men, with one accord,
        Your voices tunefully combining,
        Salute the birthday of your Lord.

        1. O gladsome Light, O Grace
        1. O gladsome Light, O Grace
        Of God the Father's Face,
        The eternal splendor wearing;
        Celestial, holy, blest,
        Our Savior Jesus Christ,
        Joyful in Thine appearing.

        2. Now, ere day fadeth quite,
        We see the evening light,
        Our wonted hymn outpouring,
        Father of might unknown,
        Thee, His incarnate Son,
        And Holy Ghost adoring.

        3. To Thee of right belongs
        All praise of holy songs,
        O Son of God, Life-giver;
        Thee, therefore, O Most High,
        The world doth glorify
        And shall exalt forever.

        1. Oh, come, all ye faithful, triumphantly sing;
        1. Oh, come, all ye faithful, triumphantly sing;
        Come, see in the manger our Savior and King
        To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
        Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

        2. True Son of the Father, He comes from the skies;
        To be born of a virgin He doth not despise.
        To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
        Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

        3. Hark, hark, to the angels all singing in heaven,
        "To God in the highest all glory be given!"
        To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
        Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

        4. To Thee, then, 0 Jesus, this day of Thy birth
        Be glory and honor through heaven and earth,
        True Godhead incarnate, omnipotent Word!
        Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

        1. To shepherds as they watched by night
        1. To shepherds as they watched by night
        Appeared a host of angels bright;
        Behold the tender Babe, they said,
        In yonder lowly manger laid.

        2. At Bethlehem, in David's town,
        As Micah did of old make known;
        'Tis Jesus Christ, your Lord and King,
        Who doth to all salvation bring.

        3. Oh, then rejoice that through His Son
        God is with sinners now at one;
        Made like yourselves of flesh and blood,
        Your brother is the eternal God.

        4. What harm can sin and death then do?
        The true God now abides with you.
        Let hell and Satan rage and chafe,
        Christ is your Brother--ye are safe.

        5. Not one He will or can forsake
        Who Him his confidence doth make.
        Let all his wiles the Tempter try,
        You may his utmost powers defy.

        6. Ye shall and must at last prevail;
        God's own ye are, ye cannnot fail.
        To God forever sing your praise
        With joy and patience all your days.

        1. Now praise we Christ, the Holy One,
        1. Now praise we Christ, the Holy One,
        The blessed Virgin Mary's Son,
        Far as the glorious sun doth shine,
        E'en to the world's remote confine.

        2. He who Himself all things did make
        A servant's form vouchsafed to take
        That He as man mankind might win
        And save His creatures from their sin.

        3. The grace and power of God the Lord
        Upon the mother was outpoured;
        A virgin pure and undefiled
        In wondrous wise conceived a child.

        4. The noble mother bore a Son,-
        For so did Gabriel's promise run,-
        Whom John confessed and leaped with joy
        Ere yet the mother knew her boy.

        5. Upon a manger filled with hay
        In poverty content He lay;
        With milk was fed the Lord of all,
        Who feeds the ravens when they call.

        6. The heavenly choirs rejoice and raise
        Their voice to God in songs of praise.
        To humble shepherds is proclaimed
        The Shepherd who the world hath framed.

        7. All honor unto Christ be paid,
        Pure Offspring of the favored maid,
        With Father and with Holy Ghost,
        Till time in endless time be lost.

        1. Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men,
        1. Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men,
        Before His highest throne;
        Today He opens heaven again
        And gives us His own Son.

        2. He leaves His heavenly Father's throne,
        Is born an infant small,
        And in a manger, poor and lone,
        Lies in a humble stall.

        3. He veils in flesh His power divine
        A servant's form to take;
        In want and lowliness must pine
        Who heaven and earth did make.

        4. He nestles at His mother's breast,
        Receives her tender care,
        Whom angels hail with joy most blest,
        King David's royal heir.

        5. 'Tis He who in these latter days
        From Judah's tribe should come,
        By whom the Father would upraise
        The Church, His Christendom.

        6. A wondrous change which He doth make!
        He takes our flesh and blood,
        And He conceals for sinners sake
        His majesty of God.

        7. He serves that I a lord may be;
        A great exchange indeed!
        Could Jesus love do more for me
        To help me in my need?

        8. He opens us again the door
        Of Paradise today;
        The angel guards the gate no more,
        To God our thanks we pay.

        1. The people that in darkness sat
        1. The people that in darkness sat
        A glorious light have seen;
        The light has shined on them who long
        In shades of death have been.

        2. To hail Thee, Sun of Righteousness,
        The gathering nations come;
        They joy as when the reapers bear
        Their harvest treasures home.

        3. For Thou their burden dost remove
        And break the tyrant's rod
        As in the day when Midian fell
        Before the sword of God.

        4. To us a Child of hope is born,
        To us a Son is given,
        And on His shoulder ever rests
        All power in earth and heaven.

        5. His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
        The Everlasting Lord,
        The Wonderful, the Counselor.
        The God by all adored.

        6. His righteous government and power
        Shall over all extend;
        On judgment and on justice based,
        His reign shall have no end.

        7. Lord Jesus, reign in us, we pray,
        And make us Thine alone,
        Who with the Father ever art
        And Holy Spirit, one.

        1. We Christians May Rejoice Today
        1. We Christians May Rejoice Today
        When Christ was born to comfort and to save us.
        Who thus believes No longer grieves,
        For none are lost who grasp the hope He gave us.

        2. Oh, wondrous joy That God most high
        Should take our flesh and thus our race should honor!
        A virgin mild Hath borne this Child;
        Such grace and glory God hath put upon her.

        3. Sin bought us grief, But Christ relief,
        When down to earth He came for our salvation.
        Since God with us Is dwelling thus,
        Who dares to speak the Christian's codemnation?

        4. The hither throng With happy song
        To Him whose birth and death are our assurance;
        Through whom are we At last set free
        From sins and burdens that surpassed endurance.

        5. Yea, let us praise Our God and raise
        Loud hallelujahs to the skies above us.
        The bliss bestowed Today by God
        To ceaseless thankfulness and joy should move us.

        1. We sing, Immanuel, Thy praise,
        1. We sing, Immanuel, Thy praise,
        Thou Prince of Life and Fount of grace,
        Thou Flower of heaven and Star of morn,
        Thou Lord of lords, Thou Virgin-born.
        Hallelujah!

        2. For Thee, since first the world was made,
        So many haearts have watched and prayed;
        The patriarchs and prophets throng
        For Thee have hoped and waited long.
        Hallelujah!

        3. Now art Thou here, Thou Ever-blest!
        In lowly manger dost Thou rest.
        Thou, making all things great, art small;
        So poor art Thou, yet clothest all.
        Hallelujah!

        4. From Thee above all gladness flows,
        Yet Thou must bear such bitter woes;
        The Gentiles Light and Hope Thou art,
        Yet findest none to soothe Thine heart.
        Hallelujah!

        5. But I, Thy servant, Lord, today
        Confess my love and freely say,
        I love Thee truly, but I would
        That I might love Thee as I should.
        Hallelujah!

        6. I have the will, the poser is weak;
        Yet, Lord, my humble offering take
        And graciously the love receive
        Which my poor heart to Thee can give.
        Hallelujah!

        7. Had I no load of sin to bear,
        Thy grace, O Lord, I could not share;
        In vain hadst Thou been born for me
        If form God's wrath I had been free.
        Hallelujah!

        8. Thus will I sing Thy praises here
        With joyful spirit year by year;
        And when we reckon years no more,
        May I in heaven Thy name adore!
        Hallelujah!

        1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
        1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
        All seated on the ground,
        The angel of the Lord came down,
        And glory shone around.
        "Fear not," said he, for mighty dread
        Had seized their troubled minds;
        "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
        To you and all mankind.

        2. "To you, in David's town, this day,
        Is born of David's line
        A Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
        And this shall be the sign:
        The heavenly Babe you there shall find
        To human view displayed,
        All meanly wrapped in swaddling-clothes
        And in a manger laid."

        3. Thus spake the seraph,--and forthwith
        Appeared a shining throng
        Of angels, praising God, and thus
        Addressed their joyful song:
        "All glory be to God on high,
        And to the earth be peace;
        Good will henceforth from Heaven to men
        Begin and never cease."

        1. Across the sky the shades of night
        1. Across the sky the shades of night
        This New Year's Eve are fleeting.
        We deck Thine altar, Lord, with light,
        In solemn worship meeting;
        And as the year's last hours go by,
        We raise to Thee our earnest cry,
        Once more Thy love entreating.

        2. Before the cross subdued we bow,
        To Thee our prayers addressing,
        Recounting all Thy mercies now,
        And all our sins confessing;
        Beseeching Thee this coming year
        To keep us in Thy faith and fear
        And crown us with Thy blessing.

        3. And while we pray, we lift our eyes
        To dear ones gone before us,
        Safe home with Thee in Paradise,
        Whose peace descendeth o'er us;
        And beg of Thee, when life is past,
        To reunite us all at last
        With those who've gone before us.

        4. We gather up in this brief hour
        The memory of Thy mercies:
        Thy wondrous goodness, love, and power
        Our grateful song rehearses;
        For Thou hast been our Strength and Stay
        In many a dark and dreary day
        Of sorrow and reverses.

        5. In many an hour when fear and dread,
        Like evil spells, have bound us
        And clouds were gathering overhead,
        Thy providence hath found us.
        In many a night when seas ran high,
        Thy gracious presence, drawing nigh,
        Hath made all calm around us.

        6. Then, 0 great God, in years to come,
        Whatever may betide us,
        Right onward through our journey home
        Be Thou at hand to guide us;
        Nor leave us till at close of life
        Safe from all perils, toil, and strife,
        Heaven shall enfold and hide us.

        1. Thou who roll'st the year around,
        1. Thou who roll'st the year around,
        Crowned with mercies large and free,
        Rich Thy gifts to us abound;
        Warm our praise shall rise to Thee.

        2. Kindly to our worship bow
        While our grateful thanks we tell,
        That, sustained by Thee, we now
        Bid the parting year farewell.

        3. All its numbered days are sped,
        All its busy scenes are o'er,
        All its joys forever fled,
        All its sorrows felt no more.

        4. Mingled with the eternal past,
        Its remembrance shall decay,
        Yet to be revived at last
        At the solemn Judgment Day.

        5. All our follies, Lord, forgive;
        Cleanse us from each guilty stain.
        Let Thy grace within us live
        That we spend not years in vain.

        6. Then when life's last eve shall come,
        Happy spirits, may we fly
        To our everlasting home,
        To our Father's house on high!

        1. To God the anthem raising,
        1. To God the anthem raising,
        Sing, Christians, great and small;
        Sing out, His goodness praising,
        Oh, thank Him one and all!
        Behold how God this year,
        Which now is safely ended,
        Hath in His love befriended
        His children far and near.

        2. Let us consider rightly
        His mercies manifold
        And let us not think lightly
        Of all His gifts untold.
        Let thankfulness recall
        How God this year hath led us,
        How He hath clothed and fed us,
        The great ones and the small.

        3. To Church and State He granted
        His peace in every place,
        His vineyard He hath planted
        Among us by His grace.
        His ever bounteous hand
        Prosperity hath given
        And want and famine driven
        From this our native land.

        4. His Father heart is yearning
        To take us for His own
        When, our transgressions mourning,
        We trust in Christ alone;
        When in His name we pray
        And humbly make confession,
        He pardons our transgression
        And is our faithful Stay.

        5. Our God hath well defended,
        Hath kept us through His grace;
        But if He had contended
        With us our sins to trace
        And given us our meed,
        We all would then be lying
        In sin and sorrow dying,
        Each one for his misdeed.

        6. O Father dear in heaven,
        For all Thy gifts of love
        Which Thou to us hast given
        We lift our thanks above.
        In Jesus name we here,
        To Thee our prayers addressing,
        Still ask Thee for Thy blessing:
        Grant us a joyful year.

        1. Wbile with ceaseless course the sun
        1. Wbile with ceaseless course the sun
        Hasted through the former year,
        Many souls their race have run,
        Nevermore to meet us here;
        Fixed in an eternal state,
        They have done with all below.
        We a little longer wait,
        But how little, none can know.

        2. As the winged arrow files
        Speedily the mark to find;
        As the lightning from the skies
        Darts and leaves no trace behind,
        Swiftly thus our fleeting days
        Bear us down life's rapid stream.
        Upward, Lord, our spirits raise;
        All below is but a dream.

        3. Thanks for mercies past receive,
        Pardon of our sins renew;
        Teach us henceforth how to live
        With eternity in view.
        Bless Thy Word to young and old,
        Fill us with a Savior's love;
        And when life's short tale is told,
        May we dwell with Thee above.

        1. Jesus! Name of wondrous love,
        1. Jesus! Name of wondrous love,
        Name all other names above,
        Unto which must every knee
        Bow in deep humility.

        2. Jesus! Name decreed of old,
        To the maiden mother told--
        Kneeling in her lowly cell--
        By the angel Gabriel.

        3. Jesus! Name of priceless worth
        To the fallen sons of earth,
        For the promise that it gave,
        "Jesus shall His people save."

        4. Jesus! Name of mercy mild,
        Given to the holy Child
        When the cup of human woe
        First He tasted here below.

        5. Jesus! Only name that's given
        Under all the mighty heaven
        Whereby man, to sin enslaved,
        Bursts his fetters and is saved.

        6. Jesus! Name of wondrous love,
        Human name of God above;
        Pleading only this, we flee,
        Helpless, 0 our God, to Thee.

        1. O blessed day when first was poured
        1. O blessed day when first was poured
        The blood of our redeeming Lord!
        O blessed day when Christ began
        His saving work for sinful man!

        2. While from His mother's bosom fed,
        His precious blood He wills to shed;
        A foretaste of His death He feels,
        An earnest of His love reveals.

        3. Scarce come to earth, His Father's will
        With prompt obedience to fulfil,
        A victim even now He lies
        Before the day of sacrifice.

        4. In love our guilt He undertakes;
        Sinless, for sin atonement makes.
        The great Lawgiver for our aid
        Obedient to the Law is made.

        5. Lord, circumcise our heart, we pray,
        And take what is not Thine away.
        Write Thine own name upon our hearts,
        Thy Law within our inward parts.

        6. O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee
        Eternal praise and glory be,
        Whom with the Father we adore
        And Holy Ghost forevermore.

        1. To the name of our salvation
        1. To the name of our salvation
        Laud and honor let us pay,
        Which for many a generation
        Hid in God's foreknowledge lay;
        But with holy exultation
        We may sing aloud today.

        2. Jesus is the name we treasure,
        Name beyond what words can tell;
        Name of gladness, name of pleasure,
        Ear and heart delighting well;
        Name of sweetness, passing measure,
        Saving us from sin and hell.

        3. 'Tis the name for adoration;
        'Tis the name of victory;
        'Tis the name for meditation
        In this vale of misery;
        'Tis the name for veneration
        By the citizens on high.

        4. 'Tis the name that whoso preacheth
        Speaks like music to the ear;
        Who in prayer this name beseecheth
        Sweetest comfort findeth near:
        Who its perfect wisdom reacheth
        Heavenly joy possesseth here.

        5. Jesus is the name prevailing
        Over every name by right;
        At this name, in terror quailing,
        Powers of hell are put to flight;
        God, in mercy never failing,
        Saves us by this name of might.

        6. Therefore we in love adoring
        This most blessed name revere,
        Holy Jesus,Thee imploring
        So to write it in us here
        That hereafter, heavenward soaring,
        We may sing with angels there.

        1. The ancient Law departs,
        1. The ancient Law departs,
        And all its fears remove,
        For Jesus makes with faithful hearts
        A covenant of love.

        2. The Light of Light Divine,
        True brightness undefiled,
        He bears for us the pain of sin
        A holy, spotless Child.

        3. His infant body now
        Begins the cross to feel:
        Those precious drops of blood that flow
        For death the Victim seal.

        4. Today the name is Thine
        At which we bend the knee.
        They call Thee Jesus, Child Divine;
        Our Jesus deign to be.

        5. All praise, eternal Son,
        For Thy redeeming love,
        With Father, Spirit, ever One
        In glorious might above. Amen.

        1. Father, let me dedicate
        1. Father, let me dedicate
        All this year to Thee,
        In whatever earthly state
        Thou wilt have me be.
        Not from sorrow, pain, or care
        Freedom dare I claim;
        This alone shall be my prayer:
        Glorify Thy name.

        2. Can a child presume to choose
        Where or how to live?
        Can a father's love refuse
        All the best to give?
        More Thou givest every day
        Than the best can claim
        Nor withholdest aught that may
        Glorify Thy name.

        3. If in mercy Thou wilt spare
        Joys that yet are mine;
        If on life, serene and fair,
        Brighter rays may shine,
        Let my glad heart while it sings
        Thee in all proclaim
        And, whate'er the future brings,
        Glorify Thy name.

        4. If Thou callest to the cross
        And its shadow come,
        Turning all my gain to loss,
        Shrouding heart and home,
        Let me think how Thy dear Son
        To His glory came
        And in deepest woe pray on:
        "Glorify Thy name."

        1. Great God, we sing that mighty hand
        1. Great God, we sing that mighty hand
        By which supported still we stand.
        The opening year Thy mercy shows;
        Let mercy crown it till it close.

        2. By day, by night, at home, abroad,
        Still we are guarded by our God,
        By His incessant bounty fed,
        By His unerring counsel led.

        3. With grateful hearts the past we own;
        The future, all to us unknown,
        We to Thy guardian care commit
        And, peaceful, leave before Thy feet.

        4. In scenes exalted or depressed
        Be Thou our Joy and Thou our Rest.
        Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,
        Adored through all our changing days.

        5. When death shall interrupt our songs,
        And seal in silence mortal tongues,
        Our Helper, God, in whom we trust,
        In better worlds our soul shall boast.

        1. Help us, O Lord! Behold, we enter
        1. Help us, O Lord! Behold, we enter
        Upon another year today;
        In Thee our hopes and thoughts now center,
        Renew our courage for the way.
        New life, new strength, new happiness,
        We ask of Thee, -- oh, hear and bless!

        2. May every plan and undertaking
        This year be all begun with Thee;
        When I am sleeping or am waking,
        Still let me know Thou art with me.
        Abroad do Thou my footsteps guide,
        At home be ever at my side.

        3. Be this a time of grace and pardon.
        Thy rod I take with willing mind,
        But suffer naught my heart to harden;
        Oh, let me then Thy mercy find!
        In Thee alone, my God, I live;
        Thou only canst nay sins forgive.

        4. And may this year to me be holy;
        Thy grace so fill my every thought
        That all my life be pure and lowly
        And truthful, as a Christian's ought.
        So make me while yet dwelling here
        Pious and blest from year to year.

        5. Jesus, be with me and direct me;
        Jesus, my plans and hopes inspire;
        Jesus, from tempting thoughts protect me;
        Jesus, be all my heart's Desire;
        Jesus, be in my thoughts all day
        Nor suffer me to fall away.

        6. And grant, Lord, when the year is over,
        That it for me in peace may close;
        In all things care for me and cover
        My head in time of fear and woes.
        So may I when my years are gone
        Appear with joy before Thy throne.

        1. For Thy mercy and Thy grace,
        1. For Thy mercy and Thy grace,
        Faithful through another year,
        Hear our song of thankfulness;
        Savior and Redeemer, hear!

        2. Lo, our sins on Thee we cast,
        Thee, our perfect Sacrifice,
        And, forgetting all the past,
        Press unto our glorious prize.

        3. Dark the future; let Thy light
        Guide us, bright and Morning Star.
        Fierce our foes and hard the fight;
        Arm us, Savior, for the war.

        4. In our weakness and distress,
        Rock of strength, be Thou our Stay;
        In the pathless wilderness
        Be our true and living Way.

        5. Who of us death's awful road
        In the coming year shall tread,
        With Thy rod and staff, 0 God,
        Comfort Thou his dying bed.

        6. Keep us faithful, keep us pure,
        Keep us evermore Thine own.
        Help, oh, help us to endure;
        Fit us for the promised crown.

        1. Now let us come before Him,
        1. Now let us come before Him,
        With song and prayer adore Him,
        Who to our life hath given
        All needed strength from heaven.

        2. The stream of years is flowing,
        And we are onward going,
        From old to new surviving
        And by His mercy thriving.

        3. In woe we often languish
        And pass through times of anguish,
        Of wars and trepidation
        Alarming every nation.

        4. As mothers watch are keeping
        O'er children who are sleeping,
        Their fear and grief assuaging
        When angry storms are raging.

        5. So God His own is shielding
        And help to them is yielding.
        When need and woe distress them,
        His loving arms caress them.

        6. O Thou who dost not slumber,
        Remove what would encumber
        Our work, which prospers never
        Unless Thou bless it ever.

        7. O God of Mercy, hear us;
        Our Father, be Thou near us;
        Mid crosses and in sadness
        Be Thou our Fount of gladness.

        8. To all who bow before Thee
        And for Thy grace implore Thee,
        Oh, grant Thy benediction
        And patience in affliction.

        9. Be Thou a Helper speedy
        To all the poor and needy,
        To all forlorn a Father;
        Thy erring children gather.

        10. Be with the sick and ailing,
        Their Comforter unfailing;
        Dispelling grief and sadness,
        Oh, give them joy and gladness!

        11. Above all else, Lord, send us
        11. Above all else, Lord, send us
        Thy Spirit to attend us,
        Within our hearts abiding,
        To heaven our footsteps guiding.

        12. All this Thy hand bestoweth,
        Thou Life, whence our life floweth.
        To all Thy name confessing
        Grant, Lord, Thy New Year's blessing.

        1. Our God, our Help in ages past,
        1. Our God, our Help in ages past,
        Our Hope for years to come,
        Our Shelter from the stormy blast,
        And our eternal Home!

        2. Under the shadow of Thy throne
        Thy saints have dwelt secure;
        Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
        And our defense is sure.

        3. Before the hills in order stood
        Or earth received her frame,
        From everlasting Thou art God,
        To endless years the same.

        4. A thousand ages in Thy sight
        Are like an evening gone,
        Short as the watch that ends the night
        Before the rising sun.

        5. Thy word commands our flesh to dust:
        "Return ye sons of men!"
        All nations rose from earth at first
        And turn to earth again.

        6. Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
        Bears all its sons away;
        They fly forgotten as a dream
        Dies at the opening day.

        7. Like flowery fields the nations stand,
        Pleased with the morning light;
        The flowers beneath the mower's hand
        Lie withering ere 'tis night.

        8. Our God, our Help in ages past,
        Our Hope for years to come,
        Be Thou our Guard while troubles last
        And our eternal Home!

        1. O Lord, our Father, thanks to Thee
        1. O Lord, our Father, thanks to Thee
        In this new year we render,
        For every evil had to flee
        Before Thee, our Defender.
        Our life was nourished, we were fed
        With rich supplies of daily bread,
        And peace reigned in our borders.

        2. Lord Jesus Christ, our thanks to Thee
        In this new year we render;
        Thy reign hath kept Thy people free,
        Hath shown Thy mercies tender.
        Thou hast redeemed us with Thy blood,
        Thou art our Joy, our only Good,
        In life and death our Savior.

        3. Lord Holy Ghost, our thanks to Thee
        In this new year we render,
        For Thou hast led our eyes to see
        Thy truth in all its splendor
        And thus enkindled from above
        Within our hearts true faith and love
        And other Christian virtues.

        4. Our faithful God, we cry to Thee:
        Still bless us with Thy favor,
        Blot out all our iniquity,
        And hide our sins forever.
        Grant us a happy, good new year
        And, when the hour of death draws near,
        A peaceful, blest departure. Amen.

        1. The old year now hath passed away;
        1. The old year now hath passed away;
        We thank Thee, 0 our God, today
        That Thou hast kept us through the year
        When danger and distress were near.

        2. We pray Thee, 0 eternal Son,
        Who with the Father reign'st as One,
        To guard and rule Thy Christendom
        Through all the ages yet to come.

        3. Take not Thy saving Word away,
        Our souls true comfort, staff, and stay.
        Abide with us and keep us free
        From errors, following only Thee.

        4. Oh, help us to forsake all sin,
        A new and holier course begin!
        Mark not what once was done amiss;
        A happier, better year be this,

        5. Wherein as Christians we may live
        Or die in peace that Thou canst give,
        To rise again when Thou shalt come
        And enter Thine eternal home.

        6. There shall we thank Thee and adore
        With all the angels evermore.
        Lord Jesus Christ, increase our faith
        To praise Thy name through life and death.

        1. As with gladness men of old
        1. As with gladness men of old
        Did the guiding star behold;
        As with joy they hailed its light,
        Leading onward, beaming bright,
        So, most gracious Lord, may we
        Evermore be led by Thee!

        2. As with joyful steps they sped,
        Savior, to Thy lowly bed,
        There to bend the knee before
        Thee whom heaven and earth adore,
        So may we with willing feet
        Ever seek Thy mercy-seat!

        3. As they offered gifts most rare
        At Thy cradle, rude and bare,
        So may we with holy joy,
        Pure and free from sin's alloy,
        All our costliest treasures bring,
        Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King!

        4. Holy Jesus, every day
        Keep us in the narrow way;
        And when earthly things are past.
        Bring our ransomed souls at last
        Where they need no star to guide,
        Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

        5. In the heavenly country bright
        Need they no created light;
        Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
        Thou its Sun which goes not down.
        There forever may we sing
        Alleluias to our King!

        1. Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
        1. Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
        Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid;
        Star of the East, the horizon adorning,
        Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

        2. Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining;
        Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall.
        Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,
        Maker and Monarch and Savior of all.

        3. Shall we not yield Him, In costly devotion
        Odors of Edom and offerings divine,
        Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,
        Myrrh from the forest and gold from the mine?

        4. Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
        Vainly with gifts would His favor secure.
        Richer by far is the heart's adoration;
        Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

        5. Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
        Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid;
        Star of the East, the horizon adorning,
        Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

        1. O Jesus, King of Glory,
        1. O Jesus, King of Glory,
        Both David's Lord and Son!
        Thy realm endures forever,
        In heaven is fixed Thy throne.
        Help that in earth's dominions,
        Throughout from pole to pole,
        Thy reign may spread salvation
        To each benighted soul.

        2. The Eastern sages, bringing
        Their tribute-gifts to Thee,
        Bear witness to Thy kingdom
        And humbly bow the knee.
        To Thee the star is pointing
        And the prophetic Word;
        Hence joyously we hail Thee:
        Our Savior and our Lord!

        3. Thou art a mighty Monarch,
        As by Thy Word is told,
        Yet carest Thou but little
        For earthly goods or gold;
        On no proud steed Thou ridest,
        Thou wear'st no jeweled crown
        Nor dwell'st in lordly castle,
        But bearest scoff and frown.

        4. Yet art Thou decked with beauty,
        With rays of glorious light;
        Thy works proclaim Thy goodness,
        And all Thy ways are right.
        Vouchsafe to shield Thy people
        With Thine almighty arm
        That they may dwell in safety
        From those who mean them harm.

        5. Ah, look on me with pity
        Though I am weak and poor;
        Admit me to Thy kingdom
        To dwell there, blest and sure.
        I pray Thee, guide and keep me
        Safe from my bitter foes,
        From sin and death and Satan;
        Free me from all my woes.

        6. And bid Thy Word within me
        Shine as the fairest star;
        Keep sin and all false doctrine
        Forever from me far.
        Help me confess Thee truly
        And with Thy Christendom
        Here own Thee King and Savior
        And in the world to come.

        1. The star proclaims the King is here;
        1. The star proclaims the King is here;
        But, Herod, why this senseless fear?
        He takes no realms of earth away
        Who gives the realms of heavenly day.

        2. The wiser Magi see from far
        And follow on His guiding star;
        And led by light, to light they press
        And by their gifts their God confess.

        3. Within the Jordan's crystal flood
        In meekness stands the Lamb of God
        And, sinless, sanctifies the wave,
        Mankind from sin to cleanse and save.

        4. At Cana first His power is shown;
        His might the blushing waters own
        And, changing as He speaks the word,
        Flow wine, obedient to their Lord.

        5. All glory, Jesus, be to Thee
        For this Thy glad epiphany;
        Whom with the Father we adore
        And Holy Ghost forevermore.

        1. O God of God, O Light of Light,
        1. O God of God, O Light of Light,
        Thou Prince of Peace, Thou King of kings!
        To Thee where angels know no night
        The song of praise forever rings.
        To Him who sits upon the throne,
        The Lamb once slain for sinful men,
        Be honor, might, all by Him won,
        Glory and praise! Amen, Amen.

        2. Deep in the prophets sacred page,
        Grand in the poets winged word,
        Slowly in type, from age to age,
        Nations beheld their coming Lord,
        Till through the deep Judean night
        Rang out the song "Good will to men!"
        Hymned by the first-born sons of light,
        Reechoed now, "Good will!" Amen.

        3. That life of truth, those deeds of love,
        That death of pain, mid hate and scorn,
        These all are past, and now above
        He reigns our King, once crowned with thorn.
        Lift up your heads, ye heavenly gates;
        So sang His hosts, unheard by men;
        Lift up your heads, for you He waits.
        We lift them up. Amen, Amen.

        4. Nations afar, in ignorance deep,
        Isles of the sea, where darkness lay,
        These hear His voice, they wake from sleep,
        And throng with joy the upward way.
        They cry with us, "Send forth Thy light,
        O Lamb, once slain for sinful men;
        Burst Satan's bonds, O God of might;
        Set all men free!" Amen, Amen.

        5. Sing to the Lord a glorious song,
        Sing to His name, His love forthtell;
        Sing on, heaven's host, His praise prolong;
        Sing, ye who now on earth do dwell:
        Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain;
        From angels praise and thanks from men;
        Worthy the Lamb, enthroned to reign,
        Glory and power! Amen, Amen.

        1. Within the Father's house
        1. Within the Father's house
        The Son hath found His home,
        And to His Temple suddenly
        The Lord of Life hath come.

        2. The doctors of the Law
        Gaze on the wondrous Child
        And marvel at His gracious words
        Of wisdom undefiled.

        3. Yet not to them is given
        The mighty truth to know,
        To Iift the earthly veil which hides
        Incarnate God below.

        4. The secret of the Lord
        Escapes each human eye,
        And faithful pondering hearts await
        The full epiphany.

        5. Lord, visit Thou our souls
        And teach us by Thy grace
        Each dim revealing of Thyself
        With loving awe to trace,

        6. Till from our darkened sight
        The cloud shall pass away
        And on the cleansed soul shall burst
        The everlasting day;

        7. Till we behold Thy face
        And know as we are known
        Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        Coequal Three in One.

        1. Songs of thankfulness and praise,
        1. Songs of thankfulness and praise,
        Jesus, Lord, to Thee we raise,
        Manifested by the star
        To the sages from afar,
        Branch of royal David's stem,
        In Thy birth at Bethlehem.
        Anthems be to Thee addressed
        God in man made manifest.

        2. Manifest at Jordan's stream,
        Prophet, Priest, and King supreme,
        And at Cana, Wedding-guest,
        In Thy Godhead manifest;
        Manifest in power divine,
        Changing water into wine.
        Anthems be to Thee addressed
        God in man made manifest.

        3. Manifest in making whole
        Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
        Manifest in valiant fight,
        Quelling all the devil's might;
        Manifest in gracious will,
        Ever bringing good from ill.
        Anthems be to Thee addressed,
        God in man made manifest.

        4. Sun and moon shall darkened be,
        Stars shall fall, the heavens shall flee;
        Christ will then like lightning shine,
        All will see His glorious sign;
        All will then the trumpet hear,
        All will see the Judge appear;
        Thou by all wilt be confessed,
        God in man made manifest.

        5. Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord,
        Mirrored in Thy holy Word;
        May we imitate Thee now
        And be pure as pure art Thou
        That we like to Thee may be
        At Thy great Epiphany
        And may praise Thee, ever blest,
        God in man made manifest.

        1. 'Tis good, Lord, to be here,
        1. 'Tis good, Lord, to be here,
        Thy glory fills the night;
        Thy face and garments, like the sun,
        Shine with unborrowed light.

        2. 'Tis good, Lord, to be here,
        Thy beauty to behold
        Where Moses and Elijah stand,
        Thy messengers of old.

        3. Fulfiller of the past,
        Promise of things to be,
        We hail Thy body glorified
        And our redemption see.

        4. Before we taste of death,
        We see Thy kingdom come;
        We fain would hold the vision bright
        And make this hill our home.

        5. 'Tis good, Lord, to be here.
        Yet we may not remain;
        But since Thou bidst us leave the mount,
        Come with us to the plain.

        1. Angels from the realms of glory,
        1. Angels from the realms of glory,
        Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
        Ye who sang creation's story,
        Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
        Come and worship,
        Come and worship;
        Worship Christ, the new-born King.

        2. Shepherds in the fields abiding,
        Watching o'er your flocks by night,
        God with man is now residing,
        Yonder shines the Infant Light:
        Come and worship:
        Come and worship,
        Worship Christ, the new-born King.

        3. Sages, leave your contemplations;
        Brighter visions beam afar;
        Seek the great Desire of nations,
        Ye have seen His natal star:
        Come and worship,
        Come and worship;
        Worship Christ, the new-born King.

        4. Saints, before the altar bending,
        Watching long in hope and fear,
        Suddenly the Lord, descending,
        In His Temple shall appear:
        Come and worship,
        Come and worship;
        Worship Christ, the new-born King.

        1. In peace and joy I now depart
        1. In peace and joy I now depart
        At God's disposing;
        For full of comfort is my heart,
        Soft reposing.
        So the Lord hath promised me,
        And death is but a slumber.

        2. 'Tis Christ that wrought this work for me,
        My faithful Savior,
        Whom Thou hast made mine eyes to see
        By Thy favor.
        Now I know He is my Life,
        My Help in need and dying.

        3. Him Thou hast unto all set forth
        Their great Salvation
        And to His kingdom called the earth,
        Every nation,
        By Thy dear and wholesome Word,
        In every place resounding.

        4. He is the Hope and saving Light
        Of lands benighted;
        By Him are they who dwelt in night
        Fed and lighted.
        He is Israel's Praise and Bliss,
        Their Joy, Reward, and Glory.

        1. Thou Light of Gentile nations,
        1. Thou Light of Gentile nations,
        Thou Savior from above,
        Drawn by Thy Spirit's leading,
        We come with joy and love
        Into Thy holy temple
        And wait with earnest mind
        As Simeon had waited
        His God and Lord to find.

        2. Yea, Lord, Thy servants meet Thee,
        In every holy place
        Where Thy true Word has promised
        That we should see Thy face.
        Today Thou still dost grant us
        Who gather round Thee here
        In arms of faith to bear Thee
        As did that aged seer.

        3.Be Thou our Joy and Brightness,
        Our Cheer in pain and loss,
        Our Sun in darkest terror,
        The Glory round our cross,
        A Star for sinking spirits,
        A Beacon in distress,
        Physician, Friend, in sickness,
        In death our Happiness.

        4. Let us, O Lord, be faithful
        Like Simeon to the end,
        So that his prayer exultant
        May from our hearts ascend:
        "O Lord, now let Thy servant
        Depart in peace, I pray,
        Since I have seen my Savior
        And here beheld His day."

        5. My Savior, I behold Thee
        With faith's enlightened eye;
        Of Thee no foe can rob me,
        His threats I can defy.
        Within Thy heart abiding,
        As Thou, O Lord, in me,
        Death can no longer frighten
        Nor part my soul from Thee.

        6. Lord, here on earth Thou seemest
        At times to frown on me,
        And through my tears I often
        Can scarce distinguish Thee;
        But in the heavenly mansions
        Shall nothing dim my sight;
        There shall I see Thy glory
        In never-changing light.

        1. In His Temple now behold Him,
        1. In His Temple now behold Him,
        See the long-expected Lord;
        Ancient prophets had foretold Him, --
        God has now fulfilled His word.
        Now, to praise Him, His redeemed
        Shall break forth with one accord.

        2. In the arms of her who bore Him,
        Virgin pure, behold Him lie,
        While His aged saints adore Him
        Ere in faith and hope they die.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
        Lo! the incarnate God most high.

        3. Jesus, by Thy presentation,
        Thou, who didst for us endure,
        Make us see our great salvation,
        Seal us with Thy promise sure,
        And present us in Thy glory
        To Thy Father, cleansed and pure.

        4. Prince and Author of salvation,
        Be Thy boundless love our theme!
        Jesus, praise to Thee be given
        By the world Thou didst redeem,
        With the Father and the Spirit,
        Lord of majesty supreme!

        1. Jesus, I will ponder now
        1. Jesus, I will ponder now
        On Thy holy Passion;
        With Thy Spirit me endow
        For such meditation.
        Grant that I in love and faith
        May the image cherish
        Of Thy suffering, pain, and death,
        That I may not perish.

        2. Make me see Thy great distress,
        Anguish, and affliction,
        Bonds and stripes and wretchedness
        And Thy crucifixion;
        Make me see how scourge and rod,
        Spear and nails, did wound Thee,
        How for man Thou diedst, O God,
        Who with thorns had crowned Thee.

        3.  Yet, O Lord, not thus alone
        Make me see Thy Passion,
        But its cause to me make known
        And its termination.
        Ah! I also and my sin
        Wrought Thy deep affliction;
        This indeed the cause hath been
        Of Thy crucifixion.

        4. Grant that I Thy Passion view
        With repentant grieving
        Nor Thee crucify anew
        By unholy living.
        How could I refuse to shun
        Every sinful pleasure
        Since for me God's only Son
        Suffered without measure?

        5. If my sins give me alarm
        And my conscience grieve me,
        Let Thy cross my fear disarm,
        Peace of conscience give me.
        Grant that I may trust in Thee
        And Thy holy Passion.
        If His Son so loveth me,
        God must have compassion.

        6. Grant that I may willingly
        Bear with Thee my crosses,
        Learning humbleness of Thee,
        Peace mid pain and losses.
        May I give Thee love for love!
        Hear me, O my Savior,
        That I may in heaven above
        Sing Thy praise forever.

        1. Enslaved by sin and bound in chains,
        1. Enslaved by sin and bound in chains,
        Beneath its dreadful tyrant sway,
        And doomed to everlasting pains,
        We wretched, guilty captives lay.

        2. Nor gold nor gems could buy our peace,
        Nor all the world's collected store
        Suffice to purchase our release;
        A thousand worlds were all too poor.

        3. Jesus, the Lord, the mighty God,
        An all-sufficient ransom paid.
        O matchless price! His precious blood
        For vile, rebellious traitors shed.

        4. Jesus the Sacrifice became
        To rescue guilty souls from hell;
        The spotless, bleeding, dying Lamb
        Beneath avenging Justice fell.

        5. Amazing goodness! Love divine!
        Oh, may our grateful hearts adore
        The matchless grace nor yield to sin
        Nor wear its cruel fetters more!

	1. A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,
	1. A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,
	The guilt of all men bearing;
	And laden with the sins of earth,
	None else the burden sharing!
	Goes patient on, grow weak and faint,
	To slaughter led without complaint,
	That spotless life to offer;
	Bears shame and stripes, and wounds and death,
	Anguish and mockery, and saith,
	"Willing all this I suffer."


	2. This Lamb is Christ, the soul's great Friend,
	The Lamb of God, our Savior;
	Him God the Father chose to send
	To gain for us His favor.
	"Go forth, My Son," the Father saith,
	"And free men from the fear of death,
	From guilt and condemnation.
	The wrath and stripes are hard to bear,
	But by Thy Passion men shall share
	The fruit of Thy salvation."

	3. "Yea, Father, yea, most willingly
	I'll bear what Thou commandest;
	My will conforms to Thy decree,
	I do what Thou demandest."
	O wondrous Love, what hast Thou done!
	The Father offers up His Son!
	The Son, content, descendeth!
	O Love, how strong Thou art to save!
	Thou beddest Him within the grave
	Whose word the mountains rendeth.

	4. From morn till eve my theme shall be
	Thy mercy's wondrous measure;
	To sacrifice myself for Thee
	Shall be my aim and pleasure.
	My stream of life shall ever be
	A current flowing ceaselessly,
	Thy constant praise outpouring.
	I'll treasure in my memory,
	O Lord, all Thou hast done for me,
	Thy gracious love adoring.

	5. Of death I am no more afraid,
	New life from Thee is flowing;
	Thy cross affords me cooling shade
	When noonday's sun is glowing.
	When by my grief I am opprest,
	On Thee my weary soul shall rest
	Serenely as on pillows.
	Thou art my Anchor when by woe
	My bark is driven to and fro
	On trouble's surging billows.

	6. And when Thy glory I shall see
	And taste Thy kingdom's pleasure,
	Thy blood my royal robe shall be,
	My joy beyond all measure.
	When I appear before Thy throne,
	Thy righteousness shall be my crown,-
	With these I need not hide me.
	And there, in garments richly wrought
	As Thine own bride, I shall be brought
	To stand in joy beside Thee.

        1. O dearest Jesus, what law hast thou broken
        1. O dearest Jesus, what law hast thou broken
        That such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?
        Of what great crime hast Thou to make confession, --
        What dark transgression?

        2. They crown Thy head with thorns, they smite, they scourge Thee;
        With cruel mockings to the cross they urge Thee;
        They give Thee gall to drink, they still decry Thee;
        They crucify Thee.

        3. Whence come these sorrows, whence this mortal anguish?
        It is my sins for which Thou, Lord, must languish;
        Yea, all the wrath, the woe, Thou dost inherit,
        This I do merit.

        4. What punishment so strange is suffered yonder!
        The Shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander;
        The Master pays the debt His servants owe Him,
        Who would not know Him.

        5. The sinless Son of God must die in sadness;
        The sinful child of man may live in gladness;
        Man forfeited his life and is acquitted, --
        God is committed.

        6. There was no spot in me by sin untainted;
        Sick with sin's poison, all my heart had fainted;
        My heavy guilt to hell had well-nigh brought me,
        Such woe it wrought me.

        7. O wondrous love, whose depth no heart hath sounded,
        That brought Thee here, by foes and thieves surrounded!
        All worldly pleasures, heedless, I was trying
        While Thou wert dying.

        8. O mighty King, no time can dim Thy glory!
        How shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?
        How shall I find some worthy gifts to proffer?
        What dare I offer?

        9. For vainly doth our human wisdom ponder, --
        Thy woes, Thy mercy, still transcend our wonder.
        Oh, how should I do aught that could delight Thee!
        Can I requite Thee?

        10. Yet unrequited, Lord, I would not leave Thee;
        I will renounce whate'er doth vex or grieve Thee
        And quench with thoughts of Thee and prayers most lowly
        All fires unholy.

        11. But since my strength will nevermore suffice me
        11. But since my strength will nevermore suffice me
        To crucify desires that still entice me,
        To all good deeds, oh, let Thy Spirit win me
        And reign within me!

        12. I'll think upon Thy mercy without ceasing,
        That earth's vain joys to me no more be pleasing;
        To do Thy will shall be my sole endeavor
        Henceforth forever.

        13. Whate'er of earthly good this life may grant me,
        I'll risk for Thee; no shame, no cross, shall daunt me;
        I shall not fear what man can do to harm me
        Nor death alarm me.

        14. But worthless is my sacrifice, I own it;
        Yet, Lord, for love's sake Thou wilt not disown it;
        Thou wilt accept my gift in Thy great meekness
        Nor shame my weakness.

        15. And when, dear Lord, before Thy throne in heaven
        To me the crown of joy at last is given,
        Where sweetest hymns Thy saints forever raise Thee,
        I, too, shall praise Thee.

        1. Jesus, grant that balm and healing
        1. Jesus, grant that balm and healing
        In Thy holy wounds I find,
        Every hour that I am feeling
        Pains of body and of mind.
        Should some evil thought within
        Tempt my treacherous heart to sin,
        Show the peril, and from sinning
        Keep me ere its first beginning.

        2. Should some lust or sharp temptation
        Prove too strong for flesh and blood,
        Let me think upon Thy Passion,
        And the breach is soon made good.
        Or should Satan press me hard,
        Let me then be on my guard,
        Saying, "Christ for me was wounded,"
        That the Tempter flee confounded.

        3. If the world my heart entices
        On the broad and easy road
        With it mirth and luring voices,
        Let me think upon the load
        Thou didst carry and endure
        That I flee all thoughts impure,
        Banishing each wild emotion,
        Calm and blest in my devotion.

        4. Every wound that pains or grieves me,
        By Thy stripes, Lord is made whole;
        When I'm faint, Thy Cross revives me,
        Granting new life to my soul.
        Yea, Thy comfort renders sweet
        Every bitter cup I meet;
        For Thy all-atoning Passion
        Has procured my soul's salvation.

        5. O my God, my Rock and Tower,
        Grant that in Thy death I trust,
        Knowing Death has lost his power
        Since Thou trod'st him in the dust.
        Savior, let Thine agony
        Ever help and comfort me;
        When I die, be my Protection,
        Light and Life and Resurrection.

        1. Jesus, Refuge of the weary,
        1. Jesus, Refuge of the weary,
        Blest Redeemer, whom we love,
        Fountain in life's desert dreary,
        Savior from the world above,
        Oh, how oft Thine eyes, offended,
        Gaze upon the sinner's fall!
        Yet, upon the cross extended,
        Thou didst bear the pain of all.

        2. Do we pass that cross unheeding,
        Breathing no repentant vow,
        Though we see Thee wounded, bleeding,
        See Thy thorn-encircled brow?
        Yet Thy sinless death hath brought us
        Life eternal, peace, and rest;
        Only what Thy grace hath taught us
        Calms the sinner's stormy breast.

        3. Jesus, may our hearts be burning
        With more fervent love for Thee!
        May our eyes be ever turning
        To Thy cross of agony
        Till in glory, parted never
        From the blessed Savior's side,
        Graven in our hearts forever
        Dwell the cross, the Crucified!

        1. Lamb of God, pure and holy,
        1. Lamb of God, pure and holy,
        Who on the cross didst suffer,
        Ever patient and lowly,
        Thyself to scorn didst offer.
        All sins Thou borest for us,
        Else had despair reigned o'er us:
        Have mercy on us, 0 Jesus!

        2. Lamb of God, pure and holy.
        Who on the cross didst suffer,
        Ever patient and lowly,
        Thyself to scorn didst offer.
        All sins Thou borest for us,
        Else had despair reigned o'er us:
        Have mercy on us, 0 Jesus!

        3. Lamb of God, pure and holy,
        Who on the cross didst suffer,
        Ever patient and lowly,
        Thyself to scorn didst offer.
        All sins Thou borest for us,
        Else had despair reigned o'er us:
        Thy peace be with us, 0 Jesus!

        1. O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest
        1. O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest
        away the sin of the world, have mercy
        upon us!

        2. O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest
        away the sin of the world, have mercy
        upon us!

        3. O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest
        away the sin of the world, grant us Thy
        peace! Amen.

        1. Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,
        My Strength by day, my Trust by night,
        On earth I'm but a passing guest
        And sorely with my sins opprest.

        2. Far off I see my fatherland,
        Where through Thy blood I hope to stand.
        But ere I reach that Paradise,
        A weary way before me lies.

        3. My heart sulks at the journey's length,
        My wasted flesh has little strength;
        My soul alone still cries in me:
        "Lord, take me home, take me to Thee!"

        4. Oh, let Thy sufferings give me power
        To meet the last and darkest hour!
        Thy blood refresh and comfort me;
        Thy bonds and fetters make me free.

        5. Oh, let Thy holy wounds for me
        Clefts in the rock forever be
        Where as a dove my soul can hide
        And safe from Satan's rage abide.

        6. And when my spirit flies away,
        Thy dying words shall be my stay.
        Thy cross shall be my staff in life,
        Thy holy grave my rest from strife.

        7. Lord, in Thy nail-prints let me read
        That Thou to save me hast decreed
        And grant that in Thine opened side
        My troubled soul may ever hide.

        8. Since Thou hast died, the Pure, the Just.
        I take my homeward way in trust.
        The gates of heaven, Lord, open wide
        When here I may no more abide.

        9. And when the last Great Day shall come
        And Thou, our Judge, shalt speak the doom,
        Let me with joy behold the light
        And set me then upon Thy right.

        10. Renew this wasted flesh of mine
        That like the sun it there may shine
        Among the angels pure and bright,
        Yea, like Thyself in glorious light.

        11. Ah, then I'll have my heart's desire,
        11. Ah, then I'll have my heart's desire,
        When, singing with the angels choir,
        Among the ransomed of Thy grace,
        Forever I'll behold Thy face!

        1. Come to Calvary's holy mountain,
        1. Come to Calvary's holy mountain,
        Sinners, ruined by the Fall;
        Here a pure and healing fountain
        Flows to you, to me, to all,
        In a full, perpetual tide,
        Opened when our Savior died.

        2. Come in poverty and meanness,
        Come defiled, without, within;
        From infection and uncleanness,
        From the leprosy of sin,
        Wash your robes and make them white;
        Ye shall walk with God in light.

        3. Come in sorrow and contrition,
        Wounded, impotent, and blind;
        Here the guilty free remission,
        Here the troubled peace, may find.
        Health this fountain will restore;
        He that drinks shall thirst no more.

        A. He that drinks shall live forever;
        Tis a soul-renewing flood.
        God is faithful; God will never
        Break His covenant of blood,
        Signed when our Redeemer died,
        Sealed when He was glorified.

        1. Christ, the Life of all the living,
        1. Christ, the Life of all the living,
        Christ, the Death of death, our foe,
        Who, Thyself for me once giving
        To the darkest depths of woe,--
        Through thy sufferings, death, and merit
        I eternal life inherit:
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        2. Thou, ah! Thou, hast taken on Thee
        Bonds and stripes, a cruel rod;
        Pain and scorn were heaped upon Thee,
        0 Thou sinless Son of God!
        Thus didst Thou my soul deliver
        From the bonds of sin forever.
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        3. Thou hast borne the smiting only
        That my wounds might all be whole;
        Thou hast suffered, sad and lonely,
        Rest to give my weary soul;
        Yea, the curse of God enduring,
        Blessing unto me securing.
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        4. Heartless scoffers did surround Thee,
        Treating Thee with shameful scorn,
        And with piercing thorns they crowned Thee.
        All disgrace Thou, Lord, hast borne
        That as Thine Thou mightest own me
        And with heavenly glory crown me.
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        5. Thou hast suffered men to bruise Thee
        That from pain I might be free;
        Falsely did Thy foes accuse Thee,--
        Thence I gain security;
        Comfortless Thy soul did languish
        Me to comfort in my anguish.
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        6. Thou hast suffered great affliction
        And hast borne it patiently,
        Even death by crucifixion,
        Fully to atone for me;
        Thou didst choose to be tormented
        That my doom should be prevented.
        Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
        Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

        7. Then, for all that wrought my pardon,
        For Thy sorrows deep and sore,
        For Thine anguish in the Garden,
        I will thank Thee evermore,
        Thank Thee for Thy groaning, sighing,
        For Thy bleeding and Thy dying,
        For that last triumphant cry,
        And shall praise Thee, Lord, on high.

        1. When o'er my sins I sorrow,
        1. When o'er my sins I sorrow,
        Lord, I will look to Thee
        And hence my comfort borrow
        That Thou wast slain for me;
        Yea, Lord, Thy precious blood was spilt
        For me, 0 most unworthy,
        To take away my guilt.

        2. Oh, what a marvelous offering!
        Behold, the Master spares
        His servants, and their suffering
        And grief for them He bears.
        God stoopeth from His throne on high;
        For me, His guilty creature,
        He deigns as man to die.

        3. My manifold transgression
        Henceforth can harm me none
        Since Jesus bloody Passion
        For me God's grace hath won.
        His precious blood my debts hath paid;
        Of hell and all its torments
        I am no more afraid.

        4. Therefore I will forever
        Give glory unto Thee,
        Jesus, loving Savior,
        For what Thou didst for me.
        I'll spend my breath in songs of thanks
        For Thy sad cry, Thy sufferings,
        Thy wrongs, Thy guiltless death.

        1. Stricken, smitten, and afflicted,
        1. Stricken, smitten, and afflicted,
        See Him dying on the tree!
        'Tis the Christ by man rejected;
        Yes, my soul, 'tis He! 'tis He!
        'Tis the long-expected Prophet,
        David's Son, yet David's Lord;
        Proofs I see sufficient of it:
        'Tis the true and faithful Word.

        2. Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning,
        Was there ever grief like His?
        Friends through fear His cause disowning,
        Foes insulting His distress;
        Many hands were raised to wound Him,
        None would interpose to save;
        But the deepest stroke that pierced Him
        Was the stroke that Justice gave.

        3. Ye who think of sin but lightly
        Nor suppose the evil great
        Here may view its nature rightly,
        Here its guilt may estimate.
        Mark the Sacrifice appointed,
        See who bears the awful load;
        'Tis the WORD, the LORD'S ANOINTED,
        Son of Man and Son of God.

        4. Here we have a firm foundation;
        Here the refuge of the lost;
        Christ's the Rock of our salvation,
        His the name of which we boast.
        Lamb of God, for sinners wounded,
        Sacrifice to cancel guilt!
        None shall ever be confounded
        Who on Him their hope have built.

        1. Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
        1. Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
        And did my Sovereign die?
        Would He devote that sacred head
        For such a worm as I?

        2. Was it for crimes that I had done
        He groaned upon the tree?
        Amazing pity, grace unknown,
        And love beyond degree!

        3. Well might the sun in darkness hide
        And shut his glories in
        When God, the mighty Maker, died
        For man the creature's sin.

        4. Thus might I hide my blushing face
        While His dear cross appears,
        Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
        And melt mine eyes to tears.

        5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay
        The debt of love I owe;
        Here, Lord, I give myself away,
        'Tis all that I can do.

        1. Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
        1. Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
        Which before the cross we spend,
        Life and health and peace possessing
        From the sinner's dying Friend.

        2. Here we rest in wonder, viewing
        All our sins on Jesus laid;
        Here we see redemption flowing
        From the sacrifice He made.

        3. Here we find the dawn of heaven
        While upon the cross we gaze,
        See our trespasses forgiven,
        And our songs of triumph raise.

        4. Oh, that, near the cross abiding,
        We may to the Savior cleave,
        Naught with Him our hearts dividing,
        All for Him content to leave!

        5. Lord, in loving contemplation
        Fix our hearts and eyes on Thee
        Till we taste Thy full salvation
        And we unveiled glory see.

        1. Not all the blood of beasts
        1. Not all the blood of beasts
        On Jewish altars slain
        Could give the guilty conscience peace
        Or wash away the stain.

        2. But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
        Takes all our sins away;
        A sacrifice of nobler name
        And richer blood than they.

        3. My faith would lay her hand
        On that dear head, of Thine
        While like a penitent I stand
        And there confess my sin.

        4. My soul looks back to see
        The burden Thou didst bear
        When hanging on the cursed tree
        And knows her guilt was there.

        5. Believing, we rejoice
        To see the curse remove;
        We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice
        And sing His bleeding love.

        1. There is a fountain filled with blood
        1. There is a fountain filled with blood
        Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
        And sinners plunged beneath that flood
        Lose all their guilty stains.

        2. The dying thief rejoiced to see
        That fountain in his day;
        And there have I, as vile as he,
        Washed all my sins away.

        3. Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
        Shall never lose its power
        Till all the ransomed Church of God
        Be saved to sin no more.

        4. E'er since by faith I saw the stream
        Thy flowing wounds supply,
        Redeeming love has been my theme
        And shall be till I die.

        5. When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
        Lies silent in the grave,
        Then in a nobler, sweeter song
        I'll sing Thy power to save.

        1. Glory be to Jesus,
        1. Glory be to Jesus,
        Who in bitter pains
        Poured for me the life-blood
        From His sacred veins!

        2. Grace and life eternal
        In that blood I find;
        Blest be His compassion,
        Infinitely kind!

        3. Blest through endless ages
        Be the precious stream
        Which from endless torments
        Did the world redeem!

        4. Abel's blood for vengeance
        Pleaded to the skies;
        But the blood of Jesus
        For our pardon cries.

        5. Oft as earth exulting
        Wafts its praise on high,
        Angel hosts rejoicing
        Make their glad reply.

        6. Lift we, then, our voices,
        Swell the mighty flood,
        Louder still and louder
        Praise the precious blood!

        1. Go to dark Gethsemane,
        1. Go to dark Gethsemane,
        Ye that feel the Tempter's power;
        Your Redeemer's conflict see,
        Watch with Him one bitter hour;
        Turn not from His griefs away,
        Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

        2. Follow to the judgment-hall,
        View the Lord of life arraigned;
        Oh, the wormwood and the gall!
        Oh, the pangs His soul sustained!
        Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
        Learn of Him to bear the cross.

        3. Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
        There, adoring at His feet,
        Mark that miracle of time,
        God's own sacrifice complete.
        "It is finished!" bear Him cry;
        Learn of Jesus Christ to die.

        4. Early hasten to the tomb
        Where they laid His breathless clay;
        All is solitude and gloom,--
        Who hath taken Him away?
        Christ is risen! He meets our eyes.
        Savior, teach us so to rise.

	1. All glory, laud, and honor
	1. All glory, laud, and honor
	To Thee, Redeemer, King,
	To whom the lips of children
	Made sweet hosannas ring.
	Thou art the King of Israel,
	Thou David's royal Son,
	Who in the Lord's name comest,
	The King and Blessed One.
	
	2. All glory, laud, and honor
	To Thee, Redeemer, King,
	To whom the lips of children
	Made sweet hosannas ring.
	The company of angels
	Are praising Thee on high,
	And mortal men and all things
	Created make reply.
	
	3. All glory, Iaud, and honor
	To Thee, Redeemer, King,
	To whom the lips of children
	Made sweet hosannas ring.
	The people of the Hebrews
	With psalms before Thee went;
	Our praise and prayer and anthems
	Before Thee we present.
	
	4. All glory, laud, and honor
	To Thee, Redeemer, King,
	To whom the lips of children
	Made sweet hosannas ring.
	To Thee, before Thy Passion,
	They sang their hymns of praise;
	To Thee, now high exalted,
	Our melody we raise.
	
	5. All glory, laud, and honor
	To Thee, Redeemer, King,
	To whom the lips of children
	Made sweet hosannas ring.
	Thou didst accept their praises;
	Accept the prayers we bring,
	Who in all good delightest,
	Thou good and gracious King.
	
	1. Hosanna, loud hosanna,
	1. Hosanna, loud hosanna,
	The little children sang;
	Through pillared court and Temple
	The lovely anthem rang.
	To Jesus, who had blessed them,
	Close folded to His breast,
	The children sang their praises,
	The simplest and the best.
	
	2. From Olivet they followed
	Mid an exultant crowd,
	The victor palm-branch waving
	And chanting clear and loud.
	The Lord of men and angels
	Rode on in lowly state
	Nor scorned that little children
	Should on His bidding wait.
	
	3. "Hosanna in the highest!"
	That ancient song we sing,
	For Christ is our Redeemer,
	The Lord of heaven our King.
	Oh, may we ever praise Him
	With heart and life and voice
	And in His blissful presence
	Eternally rejoice.

	1. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	1. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	Hark! all the tribes hosanna cry.
	0 Savior meek, pursue Thy road,
	With palms and scattered garments strowed.
	
	2. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	In lowly pomp ride on to die.
	0 Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
	O'er captive death and conquered sin.
	
	3. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	The angel armies of the sky
	Look down with sad and wondering eyes
	To see the approaching Sacrifice.
	
	4. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;
	The Father on His sapphire throne
	Expects His own anointed Son.
	
	5. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
	In lowly pomp ride on to die. 
	Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain.
	Then take, 0 Christ, Thy power and reign.

	1. The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
	1. The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
	We celebrate with one accord;
	It is our comfort in distress,
	Our heart's sweet joy and happiness.
	
	2. He blotted out with His own blood
	The judgment that against us stood;
	He full atonement for us made,
	And all our debt He fully paid.
	
	3. That this is now and ever true
	He gives an earnest ever new:
	In this His holy Supper here
	We taste His love so sweet, so near.
	
	4. His Word proclaims, and we believe.
	That in this Supper we receive
	His very body, as He said,
	His very blood for sinners shed.
	
	5. A precious food is this indeed,--
	It never fails us in our need,--
	A heavenly manna for our soul,
	Until we safely reach our goal.
	
	6. Oh, blest is each believing guest
	Who in this promise finds His rest;
	For Jesus will in love abide
	With those who do in Him confide.
	
	7. The guest that comes with true intent
	To turn to God and to repent,
	To live for Christ to die to sin,
	Will thus a holy life begin.
	
	8. They who His Word do not believe,
	This food unworthily receive,
	Salvation here will never find,--
	May we this warning keep in mind!
	
	9. Help us sincerely to believe
	That we may worthily receive
	Thy Supper and in Thee find rest.
	Amen, he who believes is blest.
	
        1. 'Twas on that dark, that doleful night
        1. 'Twas on that dark, that doleful night
        When powers of earth and hell arose
        Against the Son of God's delight
        And friends betrayed Him to His foes.
        
        2. Before the mournful scene began,
        He took the bread and blessed and brake.
        What love through all His actions ran!
        What wondrous words of grace He spake!
        
        3. "This Is My body, broke for sin;
        Receive and eat the living food";
        Then took the cup and blessed the wine:
        "'Tis the new covenant in My blood."
        
        4. "Do this," He said, "till time shall end,
        In memory of your dying Friend.
        Meet at My table and record
        The love of your departed Lord."
        
        5. Jesus, Thy feast we celebrate;
        We show Thy death, we sing Thy name,
        Till Thou return and we shall eat
        The marriage supper of the Lamb.

        1. Behold the Lamb of God!
        1. Behold the Lamb of God!
        0 Thou for sinners slain,
        Let it not be in vain
        That Thou hast died!
        Thee for my Savior let me take,
        My only refuge let me make
        Thy pierced side.
        
        2. Behold the Lamb of God!
        Into the sacred flood
        Of Thy most precious blood
        My soul I cast.
        Wash me and make me pure and clean,
        Uphold me through life's changeful scene,
        Till all be past.
        
        3. Behold the Lamb of God!
        All hail, incarnate Word!
        Thou everlasting Lord,
        Purge out our leaven;
        Clothe us with godliness and good,
        Feed us with Thy celestial food,
        Manna from heaven.
        
        4. Behold the Lamb of God!
        Worthy is He alone
        To sit upon the throne
        Of God above,
        One with the Ancient of all days,
        One with the Paraclete in praise,
        All Light, all Love!
        
        1. Savior, when in dust to Thee
        1. Savior, when in dust to Thee
        Low we bow the adoring knee,
        When, repentant, to the skies
        Scarce we lift our weeping eyes,
        Oh, by all Thy pains and woe
        Suffered once for man below,
        Bending from Thy throne on high,
        Hear our solemn litany!

        2. By Thy helpless infant years,
        By Thy life of want and tears,
        By Thy days of sore distress
        In the savage wilderness,
        By the dread, mysterious hour
        Of the insulting Tempter's power,
        Turn, O turn, a favoring eye,
        Hear our solemn litany!

        3.By Thine hour of dire despair,
        By Thine agony of prayer,
        By the cross, the nail, the thorn,
        Piercing spear, and torturing scorn,
        By the gloom that veiled the skies
        O'er the dreadful sacrifice,
        Listen to our humble cry,
        Hear our solemn litany!

        4. By Thy deep expiring groan,
        By the sad sepulchral stone,
        By the vault whose dark abode
        Held in vain the rising God,
        Oh, from earth to heaven restored,
        Mighty, reascended Lord,
        Listen, listen, to the cry
        Of our solemn litany!

        1. O darkest woe! 
        1. O darkest woe! 
        Ye tears, forth flow!
        Has earth so sad a wonder? 
        God the Father's only Son
        Now is buried yonder.
        
        2. O sorrow dread!
        God's Son is dead!
        But by His expiation
        Of our guilt upon the cross
        Gained for us salvation.
        
        3. O sinful man!
        It was the ban
        Of death on thee that brought Him
        Down to suffer for thy sins
        And such woe hath wrought Him.
        
        4. Lo, stained with blood,
        The Lamb of God,
        The Bridegroom, lies before thee,
        Pouring out His life that He
        May life restore thee.
        
        5. O Ground of faith,
        Laid low in death.
        Sweet lips. now silent sleeping!
        Surely all that live must mourn
        Here with bitter weeping.
        
        6. Oh. blest shall be
        Eternally
        Who oft in faith will ponder
        Why the glorious Prince of Life
        Should be buried yonder.

        7. O Jesus blest,
        My Help and Rest
        With tears I now entreat Thee:
        Make me love Thee to the last,
        Till in heaven I greet Thee!

        1. The royal banners forward go;
        1. The royal banners forward go;
        The cross shines forth in mystic glow
        Where He in flesh, our flesh who made,
        our sentence bore, our ransom paid;
        
        2. Where deep for us the spear was dyed,
        Life's torrent rushing from His side.
        To wash us in that precious flood
        Where mingled water flowed and blood.
        
        3. Fulfilled is all that David told
        In true prophetic song of old;
        Amidst the nations, God, saith he,
        Hath reigned and triumphed from the tree.
        
        4. O Tree of beauty, Tree of light,
        O Tree with royal purple dight;
        Elect, on whose triumphal breast
        Those holy limbs should find their rest;
        
        5. On whose dear arms, so widely flung,
        The weight of this worlds ransom hung
        The price of humankind to pay
        And spoil the spoiler of his prey.
        
        6. O Cross, our one reliance, hail!
        So may thy power with us avail
        To give new virtue to the saint
        And pardon to the penitent.
        
        7. To Thee, eternal Three in One,
        Let homage meet by all be done
        Whom by the cross Thou dost restore,
        Preserve, and govern evermore.
        
        1. Jesus Christ, our Lord most holy,
        1. Jesus Christ, our Lord most holy,
        Lamb of God so pure and lowly,
        Blameless, blameless, on the cross art offered,
        Sinless, sinless, for our sins hast suffered.
        
        2. Weep now, all ye wretched creatures,
        As ye view His gracious features.
        Jesus, Jesus, on the cross is dying,
        Nature, nature, in dark gloom is sighing.
        
        3. Christ, His last word having spoken,
        Bows His head as life is broken.
        Mournful, mournful, stands His mother weeping,
        Loved ones, loved ones, silent watch are keeping.
        
        4. The great veil was torn asunder,
        Earth did quake mid roars of thunder,
        Boulders, boulders, into bits were breaking;
        Sainted, sainted, dead from death were waking.
        
        5. As His side with spear was riven,
        Blood and water forth were given.
        Jesus, Jesus, sinners only Savior,
        Mercy, mercy, grant to us forever.
        
        1. O perfect life of love!
        1. O perfect life of love!
        All, all, is finished now,
        All that He left His throne above
        To do for us below.

        2. No work is left undone
        Of all the Father willed;
        His toil, His sorrows, one by one,
        The Scriptures have fulfilled.
        
        3. No pain that we can share
        But He has felt its smart;
        All forms of human grief and care
        Have pierced that tender heart.

        4. And on His thorn-crowned head
        And on His sinless soul
        Our sins in all that guilt were laid
        That He might make us whole.
        
        5. In perfect love He dies;
        For me He dies, for me.
        O all-atoning Sacrifice,
        I cling by faith to Thee.
        
        6. In every time of need,
        Before the judgment-throne,
        Thy works, O Lamb of God, I'll plead,
        Thy merits, not mine own.

        7. Yet work, O Lord, in me
        As Thou for me hast wrought,
        And let my love the answer be
        To grace Thy love has brought.

        1. Upon the cross extended,
        1. Upon the cross extended,
        See, world, thy Lord suspended,
        Thy Savior yields His breath.
        The Prince of Life from heaven
        Himself hath freely given
        To shame and blows and bitter death.

        2. Come hither now and ponder,
        'Twill fill thy soul with wonder,
        Blood streams from every pore.
        Through grief whose depth none knoweth,
        From His great heart there floweth
        Sigh after sigh of anguish o'er.

        3. Who is it that hath bruised Thee?
        Who hath so sore abused Thee
        And caused Thee all Thy woe?
        While we must make confession
        Of sin and dire transgression,
        Thou deeds of evil dost not know.

        4. I caused Thy grief and sighing
        By evils multiplying
        As countless as the sands.
        I caused the woes unnumbered
        With which Thy soul is cumbered,
        Thy sorrows raised by wicked hands.

        5. 'Tis I who should be smitten
        My doom should here be written:
        Bound hand and foot in hell.
        The fetters and the scourging,
        The floods around Thee surging,
        'Tis I who have deserved them well.

        6. The load Thou takest on Thee,
        That pressed so sorely on me,
        t crushed me to the ground.
        The cross for me enduring,
        The crown for me securing,
        My healing in Thy wounds is found.

        7. A crown of thorns Thou wearest,
        My shame and scorn Thou bearest,
        That I might ransomed be.
        My Bondsman, ever willing,
        My place with patience filling,
        From sin and guilt hast made me free.

        8. Thy cords of love, my Savior,
        Bind me to Thee forever,
        I am no longer mine.
        To Thee I gladly tender
        All that my life can render
        And all I have to Thee resign.

        9. Thy cross I'll place before me,
        Its saving power be o'er me,
        Wherever I may be;
        Thine innocence revealing,
        Thy love and mercy sealing,
        The pledge of truth and constancy.

        10. How God at our transgression
        To anger gives expression,
        How loud His thunder rolls,
        How fearfully He smiteth,
        How sorely He requiteth,-
        All this Thy sufferings teach my soul.

        11. When evil men revile me,
        11. When evil men revile me,
        With wicked tongues defile me,
        I'll curb my vengeful heart.
        The unjust wrong I'll suffer,
        Unto my neighbor offer
        Forgiveness for each bitter smart.

        12. Thy groaning and thy sighing,
        Thy bitter tears and dying,
        With which Thou wast opprest,-
        They shall, when life is ending,
        Be guiding and attending
        My way to Thine eternal rest.

	1. O sacred Head, now wounded,
	1. O sacred Head, now wounded,
	With grief and shame weighed down,
	Now scornfully surrounded
	With thorns, Thine only crown.
	O sacred Head, what glory,
	What bliss, till now was Thine!
	Yet, though despised and gory,
	I joy to call Thee mine.

	2. Men mock and taunt and jeer Thee,
	Thou noble countenance,
	Though mighty worlds shall fear Thee
	And flee before Thy glance.
	How art thou pale with anguish,
	With sore abuse and scorn!
	How doth Thy visage languish
	That once was bright as morn!

	3. Now from Thy cheeks has vanished
	Their color, once so fair;
	From Thy red lips is banished
	The splendor that was there.
	Grim Death, with cruel rigor,
	Hath robbed Thee of Thy life;
	Thus Thou has lost Thy vigor,
	Thy strength, in this sad strife.

	4. My burden in Thy Passion,
	Lord, Thou hast borne for me,
	For it was my transgression
	Which brought this woe on thee.
	I cast me down before Thee,
	Wrath were my rightful lot;
	Have mercy, I implore Thee;
	Redeemer, spurn me not!

	5. My Shepherd, now receive me;
	My Guardian, own me Thine.
	Great blessings Thou didst give me,
	O Source of gifts divine!
	Thy lips have often fed me
	With words of truth and love,
	Thy Spirit oft hath led me
	To heavenly joys above.

	6. Here I will stand beside Thee,
	From Thee I will not part;
	O Savior, do not chide me!
	When breaks Thy loving heart,
	When soul and body languish
	In death's cold, cruel grasp,
	Then, in Thy deepest anguish,
	Thee in mine arms I'll clasp.

	7. The joy can ne'er be spoken,
	Above all joys beside,
	When in Thy body broken
	I thus with safety hide.
	O Lord of life, desiring
	Thy glory now to see,
	Beside Thy cross expiring,
	I'd breathe my soul to Thee.

	8. What language shall I borrow
	To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
	For this, Thy dying sorrow,
	Thy pity without end?
	Oh, make me thine forever!
	And should I fainting be,
	Lord, let me never, never,
	Outlive my love for Thee.

	9. My Savior, be Thou near me
	When death is at my door;
	Then let Thy presence cheer me,
	Forsake me nevermore!
	When soul and body languish,
	Oh, leave me not alone,
	But take away mine anguish
	By virtue of Thine own!

	10. Be Thou my Consolation,
	My Shield when I must die;
	Remind me of Thy Passion
	When my last hour draws nigh.
	Mine eyes shall then behold Thee,
	Upon Thy cross shall dwell,
	My heart by faith enfold Thee.
	Who dieth thus dies well!

        1. Lord Jesus, we give thanks to Thee
        1. Lord Jesus, we give thanks to Thee
        That Thou hast died to set us free;
        Made righteous through Thy precious blood,
        We now are reconciled to God.

        2. By virtue of Thy wounds we pray,
        True God and Man, be Thou our Stay,
        Our Comfort when we yield our breath,
        Our Rescue from eternal death.

        3. Defend us, Lord, from sin and shame;
        Help us by Thine almighty name
        To bear our crosses patiently,
        Consoled by Thy great agony,

        4. And thus the full assurance gain
        That Thou to us wilt true remain
        And not forsake us in our strife
        Until we enter into life.

        1. Throned upon the awe-full tree,
        1. Throned upon the awe-full tree,
        King of grief, I watch with Thee.
        Darkness veils Thine anguished face;
        None its lines of woe can trace,
        None can tell what pangs unknown
        Hold Thee silent and alone.

        2. Silent through those three dread hours,
        Wrestling with the evil powers.
        Left alone with human sin,
        Gloom around Thee and within,
        Till the appointed time is nigh,
        Till the Lamb of God may die.

        3. Hark the cry that peals aloud
        Upward through the whelming cloud!
        Thou, the Father's only Son,
        Thou, His own Anointed One,
        Thou dost ask Him, Can it be?
        "Why hast Thou forsaken Me?"

        4. Lord, should fear and anguish roll
        Darkly o'er my sinful soul,
        Thou, who once wast thus bereft
        That Thine own might ne'er be left,
        Teach me by that bitter cry
        In the gloom to know Thee nigh.

        1. When I survey the wondrous cross
        1. When I survey the wondrous cross
        On which the Prince of glory died,
        My richest gain I count but loss
        And pour contempt on all my pride.
        
        2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
        Save in the death of Christ, my God;
        All the vain things that harm me most,
        I sacrifice them to His blood.
        
        3. See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
        Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
        Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
        Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
        
        4. Were the whole realm of nature mine
        That were a tribute far too small;
        Love so amazing, so divine,
        Demands my soul, my life, my all.

        1. Behold the Savior of mankind
        1. Behold the Savior of mankind
        Nailed to the shameful tree!
        How vast the love that Him inclined
        To bleed and die for thee!
        
        2. Hark how He groans while nature shakes
        And earth's strong pillars bend!
        The Temple's veil in sunder breaks,
        The solid marbles rend.
        
        3. 'Tis done; the precious ransom's paid;
        "Receive my soul!" He cries.
        See where He bows His sacred head;
        He bows His head and dies.
        
        4. But soon He'll break death's envious chain
        And in full glory shine.
        0 Lamb of God, was ever pain,
        Was ever love, like Thine?

	1. Our blessed Savior seven times spoke
	1. Our blessed Savior seven times spoke
	When on the cross our sins He took
	And died lest man should perish.
	Let us His last and dying words
	In our remembrance cherish.
	
	2. "Father, forgive these men, for, lo,
	They truly know not what they do."
	So far His love extended.
	Forgive us, Lord, for we, too, have
	Through ignorance offended.
	
	3. Now to the contrite thief He cries:
	"Thou, verily, in paradise
	Shalt meet Me ere tomorrow."
	Lord, take us to Thy kingdom soon
	Who linger here in sorrow.

	4. To weeping Mary, standing by,
	"Behold thy son!" now hear him cry;
	To John, "Behold thy mother!"
	Provide, O Lord, for those we leave:
	Let each befriend the other.
	
	5. The Savior's fourth word was "I thirst!"
	O mighty Prince of Life, Thy thirst
	For us and our salvation
	Is truly great; do help us, then,
	That we escape damnation.
	
	6. The fifth, "My God, My God, oh, why
	Forsake Me?" Hark. the awe-full cry!
	Lord, Thou wast here forsaken
	That we might be received on high;
	Let this hope not be shaken.
	
	7. The sixth, when victory was won,
	"'Tis finished!" for Thy work was done.
	Grant, Lord, that, onward pressing,
	We may the Work Thou dost impose
	Fulfil with Thine own blessing.

	8. The last, as woe and sufferings end,
	"O God, My Father, I commend
	Into Thy hands My spirit."
	Be this, dear Lord, my dying wish;
	O heavenly Father, hear it.
	
	9. Whoe'er, by sense of sin opprest,
	Upon these words his thoughts will rest,
	He Joy and hope obtaineth
	And, through God's love and boundless grace
	A peaceful conscience gaineth.
	
	10. O Jesus Christ, Thou Crucified,
	Who hast for our offenses died,
	Grant that we e'er may ponder
	Thy wounds, Thy cross, Thy bitter death,
	Both here below and yonder.

	1. We sing the praise of Him who died,
	1. We sing the praise of Him who died,
	Of Him who died upon the cross;
	The sinners Hope let men deride,
	For this we count the world but loss.
	
	2. Inscribed upon that cross we see
	In shining letters "God is Love."
	He bears our sins upon the tree,
	He brings us mercy from above.
	
	3. The cross!--it takes our guilt away.
	It holds the fainting spirit up,
	It cheers with hope the gloomy day,
	And sweetens every bitter cup.
	
	4. It makes the coward spirit brave
	And nerves the feeble arm for fight;
	It takes all terror from the grave
	And gilds the bed of death with light.
	
	5. The balm of life, the cure of woe,
	The measure and the pledge of love,
	The sinners refuge here below,
	The angels theme in heaven above.

        1. On my heart imprint Thine image,
        1. On my heart imprint Thine image,
        Blessed Jesus, King of Grace,

        1. Halleluia! Jesus Lives!
        1. Halleluia! Jesus Lives!
        He is now the Living One;
        From the gloomy house of death
        Forth the Conqueror has gone,
        Bright Forerunner to the skies
        Of His people, yet to rise.
        
        2. Jesus lives! Let all rejoice;
        Praise Him, ransomed ones of earth.
        Praise Him in a nobler song,
        Cherubim of heavenly birth.
        Praise the Victor-King, whose sway
        Sin and death and hell obey.
        
        3. Jesus lives! Why weepest thou?
        Why that sad and frequent sigh?
        He who died our Brother here
        Lives our Brother still on high,
        Lives forever to bestow
        Blessings on His Church below.
        
        4. Jesus Iives! And thus, my soul,
        Life eternal waits for thee;
        Joined to Him, thy living Head,
        Where He is, thou, too, shalt be;
        With Himself, at His right hand,
        Victor over death shalt stand.

        5. Jesus lives! To Him my heart
        Draws with ever new delight.
        Earthly vanities, depart,
        Hinder not my heavenward flight.
        Let this spirit ever rise     
        To its magnet in the skies.
        
        6. Halleluja, angels, sing!
        Join us in our hymn of praise,
        Let your chorus swell the strain
        Which our feebler voices raise:
        Glory to our God above
        And on earth His peace and love!
        
       
        1. He is arisen! Glorious word!
        1. He is arisen! Glorious word!
        Now reconciled is God, my Lord;
        The gates of heaven are open.
        My Jesus did triumphant die,
        And Satan's arrows broken lie,
        Destroyed hell's direst weapon.
        Oh, hear
        What cheer!
        Christ victorious
        Riseth glorious,
        Life He giveth--
        He was dead, but see, He liveth!

        1. Christ the Lord is risen again!
        1. Christ the Lord is risen again!
        Christ has broken death's strong chain!
        Hark, the angels shout for joy
        Singing evermore on high:
        Hallelujah!
        
        2. He who gave for us His life.
        Who for us endured the strife,
        Is our Paschal Lamb today.
        We, too, sing for joy and say:
        Hallelujah!
        
        3. He who bore all pain and loss
        Comfortless upon the cross
        Lives in glory now on high,
        Pleads for us and hears our cry:
        Hallelujah!
        
        4. He whose path no records tell
        Hath descended into hell;
        He the strong man armed hath bound
        And in highest heaven is crowned.
        Hallelujah!
        
        5. He who slumbered in the grave
        Is exalted now to save;
        Now through Christendom it rings
        That the Lamb is King of kings.
        Hallelujah!
        
        6. Now He bids us tell abroad
        How the lost may be restored,
        How the penitent forgiven,
        How we, too, may enter heaven.
        Hallelujah!
        
        7. Thou our Paschal Lamb indeed,
        Christ, today Thy people feed;
        Take our sins and guilt away
        That we all may sing for aye:
        Hallelujah!

	1. Christ the Lord is risen today; Alleluia!
	1. Christ the Lord is risen today; Alleluia!
	Christians, haste your vows to pay; Alleluia!
	Offer ye your praises meet Alleluia!
	At the Paschal Victim's feet. Alleluia!
	
	2.For the sheep the Lamb hath bled, Alleluia!
	Sinless in the sinners stead. Alleluia!
	"Christ is risen," today we cry; Alleluia!
	Now He lives no more to die. Alleluia!
	
	3. Christ, the Victim undefiled, Alleluia!
	God and man hath reconciled Alleluia!
	While in strange and awe-full strife Alleluia!
	Met together Death and Life: Alleluia!
	
	4. Christians, on this happy day Alleluia!
	Haste with joy your vows to pay. Alleluia!
	"Christ is risen," today we cry; Alleluia!
	Now He lives no more to die. Alleluia!
	
	5. Christ, who once for sinners bled, Alleluia!
	Now the First-born from the dead, Alleluia!
	Throned in endless might and power, Alleluia!
	Lives and reigns forevermore. Alleluia!
	
	6. Hail, eternal Hope on high! Alleluia!
	Hail, Thou King of victory! Alleluia!
	Hail, Thou Prince of Life adored! Alleluia!
	Help and save us, gracious Lord. Alleluia!

        1. Awake, my heart, with gladness,
        1. Awake, my heart, with gladness,
        See what today is done,
        Now after gloom and sadness
        Comes forth the glorious Sun!
        My Savior there was laid
        Where our bed must be made
        When to the realms of light
        Our spirit wings its flight.

        2. The Foe in triumph shouted
        When Christ lay in the tomb,
        But, lo, he now is routed,
        His boast is turned to gloom.
        For Christ again is free;
        In glorious victory
        He who is strong to save
        Has triumphed o'er the grave.

        3. This is a sight that gladdens;
        What peace it doth impart!
        Now nothing ever saddens
        The joy within my heart;
        No gloom shall ever shake,
        No foe shall ever take,
        The hope which God's own Son
        In love for me hath won.

        4. Now hell, its prince, the devil,
        Of all their power are shorn;
        Now I am safe from evil,
        And sin I laugh to scorn.
        Grim death with all his might
        Cannot my soul affright;
        He is a powerless form,
        Howe'er he rave and storm.

        5. The world against me rageth,
        Its fury I disdain;
        Though bitter war it wageth,
        Its work is all in vain.
        My heart from care is free,
        No trouble troubles me.
        Misfortune now is play,
        And night is bright as day.

        6. Now I will cling forever
        To Christ, my Savior true;
        My Lord will leave me never,
        Whate'er He passes through.
        He rends Death's iron chain,
        He breaks through sin and pain,
        He shatters hell's dark thrall,-
        I follow through it all.

        7. To halls of heavenly splendor
        With Him I penetrate;
        And trouble ne'er may hinder
        Nor make me hesitate.
        Let tempests rage at will,
        My Savior shields me still;
        He grants abiding peace
        And bids all tumult cease.

        8. He brings me to the portal
        That leads to bliss untold
        Whereon this rime immortal
        Is found in script of gold:
        "Who there My cross hath shared
        Finds here a crown prepared;
        Who there with Me has died
        Shall here be glorified."

        1. Christ the Lord is risen today,
        1. Christ the Lord is risen today,
        Sons of men and angels say.
        Raise your joys and triumphs high;
        Sing, ye heavens, and, earth, reply.
        
        2. Love's redeeming work is done,
        Fought the fight, the battle won.
        Lo, our Sun's eclipse is o'er;
        Lo, He sets in blood no more.
        
        3. Vain the stone, the watch, the seal;
        Christ has burst the gates of hell.
        Death in vain forbids His rise;
        Christ has opened Paradise.
        
        4. Lives again our glorious King;
        Where, 0 Death, is now thy sting?
        Once He died our souls to save;
        Where thy victory, O Grave?

        5. Soar we now where Christ has led,
        Following our exalted Head.
        Made like Him, like Him we rise;
        Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.

        6. Hail the Lord of earth and heaven!
        Praise to Thee by both be given!
        Thee we greet triumphant now:
        Hail, the Resurrection Thou!

        1. "Abide with us, the day is waning,"
        1. "Abide with us, the day is waning,"
        Thus prayed the two while on the way;
        We read that Thou, 0 Lord, remaining,
        Didst all their doubts and fears allay.
        Incline Thine ear, Thou King of Grace,
        When, praying thus, we see Thy face.
        
        2. At eventide, Thy Spirit sending,
        Help us, 0 Lord, our watch to keep,
        In prayer devout before Thee bending
        Ere our eyelids close in sleep,
        Confessing sin in deed and word
        With hope of mercy from the Lord.
        
        3. Abide with us; with heavenly gladness
        Illumine, Lord, our darkest day;
        And when we weep in pain and sadness,
        Be Thou our Solace, Strength, and Stay.
        Tell of Thy woe, Thy victory won,
        When Thou didst pray: "Thy will be done."
        
        4. Abide with us, 0 Savior tender,
        That bitter day when life shall end,
        When to the grave we must surrender,
        And fear and pain our hearts shall rend.
        The shield of faith do Thou bestow
        When trembling we must meet the foe.

        5. When earthly help no more availeth,
        To sup with us Thou wilt be nigh;
        Thou givest strength that never faileth.
        In Thee we grave and death defy.
        While earth is fading from our sight,
        Our eyes behold the realms of light.

        1. Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands,
        1. Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands,
        For our offenses given;
        But now at God's right hand He stands
        And brings us life from heaven;
        Therefore let us joyful be
        And sing to God right thankfully
        Loud songs of hallelujah!
        Hallelujah!

        2. It was a strange and dreadful strife
        When Life and Death contended;
        The victory remained with Life,
        The reign of Death was ended;
        Holy Scripture plainly saith
        That Death is swallowed up by Death,
        His sting is lost forever.
        Hallelujah!

        3. Here the true Paschal Lamb we see,
        Whom God so freely gave us;
        He died on the accursed tree-
        So strong His love!-to save us.
        See, His blood doth mark our door;
        Faith points to it, Death passes o'er,
        And Satan cannot harm us.
        Hallelujah!

        4. So let us keep the festival
        Whereto the Lord invites us;
        Christ is himself the Joy of all,
        The Sun that warms and lights us.
        By His grace He doth impart
        Eternal sunshine to the heart;
        The night of sin is ended.
        Hallelujah!

        5. Then let us feast this Easter Day
        On Christ, the Bread of heaven;
        The Word of Grace hath purged away
        The old and evil leaven.
        Christ alone our souls will feed,
        He is our meat and drink indeed;
        Faith lives upon no other.
        Hallelujah!

        1. I am content! My Jesus liveth still,
        1. I am content! My Jesus liveth still,
        In whom my heart is pleased.
        He hath fulfilled the Law of God for me,
        God's wrath He hath appeased.
        Since He in death could perish never,
        I also shall not die forever.
        I am content!

        2. I am content!  My Jesus is my Head;
        His member I will be.
        He bowed His head when on the cross He died
        With cries of agony.
        Now death is brought into subjection
        For me, too, by His resurrection.
        I am content!

        3. I am content! My Jesus is my Lord,
        My Prince of Life and Peace;
        His heart is yearning for my future bliss
        And for my soul's release.
        The home where He, my Master, liveth
        He also to His servant giveth.
        I am content!

        4. I am content! My Jesus is my Light,
        My radiant Sun of Grace.
        His cheering rays beam blessings forth for all,
        Sweet comfort, hope, and peace.
        This Easter sun doth bring salvation
        And everlasting exultation.
        I am content!

        5. I am content! Lord, draw me unto Thee
        And wake me from the dead
        That I may rise forevermore to be
        With Thee, my living Head.
        The fetters of my body sever,
        Then shall my soul rejoice forever.
        I am content!

        1. Where wilt Thou go since night draws near,
        1. Where wilt Thou go since night draws near,
        O Jesus Christ, Thou Pilgrim dear?
        Lord, make me happy, be my Guest,
        And in my heart, oh, deign to rest.

        2. Grant my request, O dearest Friend,
        For truly I the best intend;
        Thou knowest that Thou ever art
        A welcome Guest unto my heart.

        3. The day is now far spent and gone,
        The shades of night come quickly on;
        Abide with me, Thou heavenly Light,
        And do not leave me in this night.

        4. Enlighten me that from the way
        That leads to heaven I may not stray,
        That I may never be misled,
        Though night of sin is round me spread.

        5. And when I on my death-bed lie,
        Help me that I in peace may die.
        Abide! I will not let Thee go.
        Thou wilt not leave me, Lord, I know.

        1. I know that my Redeemer lives;
        1. I know that my Redeemer lives;
        What comfort this sweet sentence gives!
        He lives, He lives, who once was dead;
        He lives, my ever-living Head.
        
        2. He lives triumphant from the grave,
        He lives eternally to save,
        He lives all-glorious in the sky,
        He lives exalted there on high.
        
        3. He lives to bless me with His love,
        He lives to plead for me above.
        He lives my hungry soul to feed,
        He lives to help in time of need.
        
        4. He lives to grant me rich supply,
        He lives to guide me with His eye,
        He lives to comfort me when faint,
        He lives to hear my soul's complaint.
        
        5. He lives to silence all my fears,
        He lives to wipe away my tears
        He lives to calm my troubled heart,
        He lives all blessings to impart.
        
        6. He lives, my kind, wise, heavenly Friend,
        He lives and loves me to the end;
        He lives, and while He lives, I'll sing;
        He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.
        
        7. He lives and grants me daily breath;
        He lives, and I shall conquer death:
        He lives my mansion to prepare;
        He Iives to bring me safely there.
        
        8. He lives, all glory to His name!
        He lives, my Jesus, still the same.
        Oh, the sweet joy this sentence gives,
        "I know that my Redeemer lives!"
        
        1. Jesus lives! The victory's won!
        1. Jesus lives! The victory's won!
        Death no longer can appal me;
        Jesus lives! Death's reign is done!
        From the grave Christ will recall me.
        Brighter scenes will then commence;
        This shall be my confidence.
        
        2. Jesus lives! To Him the throne
        High o'er heaven and earth is given.
        I shall go where He is gone,
        Live and reign with Him in heaven.
        God is faithful. Doubtings, hence!
        This shall be my confidence.
        
        3. Jesus lives! For me He died,
        Hence will I, to Jesus living,
        Pure in heart and act abide,
        Praise to Him and glory giving.
        Freely God doth aid dispense;
        This shall be my confidence.
        
        4. Jesus lives! I know full well
        Naught from me His love shall sever;
        Life nor death nor powers of hell
        Part me now from Christ forever.
        God will be a sure Defense;
        This shall be my confidence.
        
        5. Jesus lives! and now is death
        But the gate of life immortal;
        This shall calm my trembling breath
        When I pass its gloomy portal.
        Faith shall cry, as fails each sense,
        Jesus is my confidence!
        
        1. "Welcome, happy morning!" Age to age shall say;
        1. "Welcome, happy morning!" Age to age shall say;
        Hell today is vanquished, heaven is won today!"
        Lo, the Dead is living, God forevermore!
        Him, their true Creator, all His works adore.
        "Welcome, happy morning!" age to age shall say;
        Hell today is vanquished, heaven is won today!"

        2. Maker and Redeemer, Life and Health of all,
        Thou from heaven beholding human nature's fall,
        Of the Father's Godhead, true and only Son.
        Manhood to deliver manhood didst put on.
        "Welcome, happy morning!" age to age shall say;
        Hell today is vanquished, heaven is won today!"

 
        3. Thou, of life the Author, death didst undergo,
        Tread the path of darkness, saving strength to show.
        Come, then, True and Faithful, now fulfil Thy word;
        'Tis Thine own third morning--rise, 0 buried Lord!
        "Welcome, happy morning!" age to age shall say;
        Hell today is vanquished, heaven is won today!"

        4. Loose the souls long prisoned, bound with Satan's chain;
        All that now is fallen raise to life again.
        Show Thy face in brightness, bid the nations see;
        Bring again our daylight; day returns with Thee.
        "Welcome, happy morning!" age to age shall say;
        Hell today is vanquished, heaven is won today!"

        1. Morning breaks upon the tomb;
        1. Morning breaks upon the tomb;
        Jesus scatters all its gloom.
        Day of triumph through the skies;
        See the glorious Savior rise.

        2. Ye who are of death afraid
        Triumph in the scattered shade.
        Drive your anxious cares away;
        See the place where Jesus lay.

        3. Christians, dry your flowing tears
        Chase your unbelieving fears;
        Look on His deserted grave,
        Doubt no more His power to save.

        1. Come, ye faithful, raise the strain
        1. Come, ye faithful, raise the strain
        Of triumphant gladness;
        God hath brought His Israel
        Into joy from sadness.
        'Tis the spring of souls today:
        Christ hath burst His prison
        And from three days sleep in death
        As a sun hath risen.

        2. All the winter of our sins,
        Long and dark, is flying
        From His light, to whom we give
        Laud and praise undying.
        Neither could the gates of death
        Nor the tomb's dark portal
        Nor the watchers nor the seal
        Hold Thee as a mortal.

        3. But today amidst Thine own
        Thou didst stand, bestowing
        That Thy peace which evermore
        Passeth human knowing.
        Come, ye faithful, raise the strain
        Of triumphant gladness;
        God hath brought His Israel
        Into joy from sadness.

        1. The day of resurrection,
        1. The day of resurrection,
        Earth, tell it out abroad,
        The Passover of gladness.
        The Passover of God.
        From death to life eternal,
        From this world to the sky,
        Our Christ hath brought us over
        With hymns of victory.

        2. Our hearts be pure from evil
        That we may see aright
        The Lord in rays eternal
        Of resurrection light
        And, listening to His accents,
        May hear, so calm and plain,
        His own "All hail!" and, hearing,
        May raise the victor strain.

        3. Now let the heavens be joyful,
        Let earth her song begin,
        Let all the world keep triumph
        And all that is therein.
        Let all things, seen and unseen,
        Their notes of gladness blend;
        For Christ the Lord hath risen,--
        Our joy, that hath no end.

        1. Jesus Christ, my sure Defense
        1. Jesus Christ, my sure Defense
        And my Savior, ever Iiveth;
        Knowing this, my confidence
        Rests upon the hope it giveth
        Though the night of death be fraught
        Still with many an anxious thought.
        
        2. Jesus, my Redeemer, lives;
        I, too, unto life shall waken.
        Endless joy my Savior gives;
        Shall my courage, then, be shaken?
        Shall I fear, or could the Head
        Rise and leave His members dead?

        3. Nay, too closely am I bound
        Unto Him by hope forever;
        Faith's strong hand the Rock hath found,
        Grasped it, and will leave it never;
        Even death now cannot part
        From its Lord the trusting heart.
        
        4. I am flesh and must return
        Unto dust, whence I am taken;
        But by faith I now discern
        That from death I shall awaken
        With my Savior to abide
        In His glory, at His side.
        
        5. Glorified, I shall anew
        With this flesh then be enshrouded;
        In this body I shall view
        God, my Lord, with eyes unclouded;
        In this flesh I then shall see
        Jesus Christ eternally.
        
        6. Then these eyes my Lord shall know,
        My Redeemer and my Brother;
        In His love my soul shall glow,--
        I myself, and not another!
        Then the weakness I feel here
        Shall forever disappear.
        
        7. They who sorrow here and moan
        There in gladness shall be reigning;
        Earthly here the seed is sown,
        There immortal life attaining.
        Here our sinful bodies die,
        Glorified to dwell on high.
        
        8. Then take comfort and rejoice,
        For His members Christ will cherish.
        Fear not, they will hear His voice;
        Dying, they shall never perish;
        For the very grave is stirred
        When the trumpet's blast is heard.
        
        9. Laugh to scorn the gloomy grave
        And at death no longer tremble;
        He, the Lord, who came to save
        Will at last His own assemble.
        They will go their Lord to meet,
        Treading death beneath their feet.
        
        10. Oh, then, draw away your hearts
        Now from pleasures base and hollow.
        There to share what He imparts,
        Here His footsteps ye must follow.
        Fix your hearts beyond the skies,
        Whether ye yourselves would rise.
        
        1. Like the golden sun ascending,
        1. Like the golden sun ascending,
        Breaking through the gloom of night,
        On the earth his glory spending
        So that darkness takes to flight,
        Thus my Jesus from the grave
        And Death's dismal, dreadful cave
        Rose triumphant Easter morning
        At the early purple dawning.

        2. Thanks to Thee, O Christ victorious!
        Thanks to Thee, O Lord of Life!
        Death hath now no power o'er us,
        Thou hast conquered in the strife.
        Thanks because Thou didst arise
        And hast opened Paradise!
        None can fully sing the glory
        Of the resurrection story.

        3. Though I be by sin o'ertaken,
        Though I lie in helplessness,
        Though I be by friends forsaken
        And must suffer sore distress,
        Though I be despised, contemned,
        And by all the world condemned,
        Though the dark grave yawn before me,
        Yet the light of hope shines o'er me.

        4. Thou hast died for my transgression,
        All my sins on Thee were laid;
        Thou hast won for me salvation,
        On the cross my debt was paid.
        From the grave I shall arise
        And shall meet Thee in the skies.
        Death itself is transitory;
        I shall lift my head in glory.

        5. Grant me grace, O blessed Savior,
        And Thy Holy Spirit send
        That my walk and my behavior
        May be pleasing to the end;
        That I may not fall again
        Into death's grim pit and pain,
        Whence by grace Thou hast retrieved me
        And from which Thou hast relieved me.

        6. For the joy Thy advent gave me,
        For Thy holy, precious Word;
        For Thy Baptism, which doth save me,
        For Thy blest Communion board;
        For Thy death, the bitter scorn,
        For Thy resurrection morn,
        Lord, I thank Thee and extol Thee,
        And in heaven I shall behold Thee.

        1. Ye sons and daughters of the King,
        1. Ye sons and daughters of the King,
        Whom heavenly hosts in glory sing,
        Today the grave hath lost its sting:
        Alleluia!
        
        2. On that first morning of the week,
        Before the day began to break,
        The Marys went their Lord to seek:
        Alleluia!
        
        3. An angel bade their sorrow flee,
        For thus he spake unto the three:
        "Your Lord is gone to Galilee":
        Alleluia!
        
        4. That night the Apostles met in fear,
        Amidst them came their Lord most dear
        And said: "Peace be unto you here":
        Alleluia!
        
        5. When Thomas afterwards had heard
        That Jesus had fulfilled His word,
        He doubted if it were the Lord:
        Alleluia!
        
        6. "Thomas, behold My side," saith He,
        "My hands, My feet, My body, see;
        "And doubt not, but believe in Me":
        Alleluia!
        
        7. No longer Thomas then denied;
        He saw the feet, the hands, the side;
        "Thou art my Lord and God," he cried:
        Alleluia!
        
        8. Blessed are they that have not seen
        And yet whose faith hath constant been,
        In Iife eternal they shall reign:
        Alleluia!
        
        9. On this most holy day of days
        To God your hearts and voices raise
        In laud and jubilee and praise:
        Alleluia!
        
        10. And we with holy Church unite,
        As evermore is just and right,
        In glory to the King of light:
        Alleluia!

        1. Who Is this that comes from Edom,
        1. Who Is this that comes from Edom,
        All His raiment stained with blood;
        To the captive speaking freedom,
        Bringing and bestowing good;
        Glorious in the garb He wears,
        Glorious in the spoil He bears?
        
        2. 'Tis the Savior, now victorious,
        Traveling onward in His might;
        'Tis the Savior; oh, how glorious
        To His people is the sight!
        Satan conquered and the grave,
        Jesus now is strong to save.
        
        3. Why that blood His raiment staining?
        'Tis the blood of many slain;
        Of His foes there's none remaining,
        None the contest to maintain.
        Fall'n they are, no more to rise;
        All their glory prostrate lies.
        
        4. Mighty Victor, reign forever,
        Wear the crown so dearly won;
        Never shall Thy people, never,
        Cease to sing what Thou hast done.
        Thou hast fought Thy people's foes;
        Thou hast healed Thy people's woes.

        1. Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
        1. Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
        The strife is o'er, the battle done;
        Now is the Victor's triumph won;
        Now be the song of praise begun.
        Alleluia!
        
        2. Death's mightiest powers have done their worst,
        And Jesus hath His foes dispersed;
        Let shouts of praise and joy outburst.
        Alleluia!
        
        3. On the third morn He rose again
        Glorious in majesty to reign;
        Oh, let us swell the joyful strain!
        Alleluia!
        
        4. He closed the yawning gates of hell;
        The bars from heaven's high portals fell.
        Let songs of praise His triumph tell.
        Alleluia!
        
        5. Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee.
        From death's dread sting Thy servants free
        That we may live and sing to Thee.
        Alleluia!

        1. A Hymn of glory let us sing:
        1. A Hymn of glory let us sing:
        New songs throughout the world shall ring:
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Chirst, by a road before untrod,
        Ascendeth to the throne of God.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        2. The holy apostolic band
        Upon the Mount of Olives stand;
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        And with His followers they see
        Jesus resplendent majesty.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        3. To whom the angels, drawing nigh,
        "Why stand and gaze upon the sky?
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        This is the Savior!" thus they say;
        "This is His noble triumph-day."
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        4. "Again shall ye behold Him so
        As ye today have seen Him go,
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        In glorious pomp ascending high,
        Up to the portals of the sky."
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        5. Oh, grant us thitherward to tend
        And with unwearied hearts ascend
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Unto Thy kingdom's throne, where Thou,
        As is our faith, art seated now.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        6. Be Thou our Joy and strong Defense
        Who art our future Recompense:
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        Be ours through all eternity.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        7. O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
        All praise to Thee let earth accord,
        Alleluia! Alleluia!
        Who art, while endless ages run,
        With Father and with Spirit One.
        Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

        1. Lo, God to heaven ascendeth!
        1. Lo, God to heaven ascendeth!
        Throughout its regions vast
        With shouts triumphant blendeth
        The trumpet's thrilling blast:
        Sing praise to Christ the Lord;
        Sing priase with exultation,
        King of each heathen nation,
        The God of hosts adored!

        2. With joy is heaven resounding
        Chirst's glad return to see;
        Behold the saints surrounding
        The Lord who set them free.
        Bright myriads, thronging, come;
        The cherub band rejoices,
        And loud seraphic voices
        All welcome Jesus home.

        3. From cross to throne ascending,
        We follow Chirst on high
        And know the pathway wending
        To mansions in the sky.
        Our Lord is gone before;
        Yet here He will not leave us,
        But soon in heaven receive us
        And open wide the door.

        4. Our place He is preparing;
        To heaven we, too, shall rise,
        With Him His glory sharing,
        Be where our Treasure lies.
        Bestir thyself, my soul!
        Where Jesus Christ has entered,
        There let thy hope be centered;
        Press onward toward the goal.

        5. Let all our thoughts be winging
        To where Thou didst ascend,
        And let our hearts be singing:
        "We seek Thee, Christ, our Friend,
        Thee, God's exalted Son,
        Our Life, and Way to heaven,
        To whom all power is given,
        Our Joy and Hope and Crown."

        1. Draw us to Thee,
        1. Draw us to Thee,
        For then shall we
        Walk in Thy steps forever
        And hasten on
        Where Thou art gone
        To be with Thee, dear Savior.

        2.  Draw us to Thee,
        Lord, lovingly;
        Let us depart with gladness
        That we may be
        Forever free
        From sorrow, grief, and sadness.

        3. Draw us to Thee;
        Oh, grant that we
        May walk the road to heaven!
        Direct our way
        Lest we should stray
        And from Thy paths be driven.

        4. Draw us to Thee
        That also we
        Thy heavenly bliss inherit
        And ever dwell
        Where sin and hell
        No more can vex our spirit.

        5. Draw us to Thee
        Unceasingly,
        Into Thy kingdom take us;
        Let us fore'er
        Thy glory share,
        Thy saints and joint heirs make us.

        1. Oh, sing with exultation,
        1. Oh, sing with exultation,
        Sing to the Lord, rejoice,
        And in His congregation
        Shout with triumphant voice.
        For, lo, at God's right hand
        Is Christ in glory seated;
        With death and hell defeated,
        As Victor doth command.

        2. Since Christ, our Lord, is living,
        We nevermore shall die;
        To God the glory giving,
        We rise to Him on high.
        Though chastened we may be
        Andto our graves be taken,
        We unto life shall waken
        And live eternally.

        3. Christ is the sure Foundation
        The builder did reject,
        But He four our salvation
        Is precious and elect
        And made the Corner-stone
        On which the Church is founded;
        This marvel now is sounded,
        The work of God alone.

        4. To Thee, O Christ, be glory,
        Who camest in His name!
        Thy people sing the story
        Thy praises to proclaim.
        We thank Thee and adore,
        O Christ, our Lord and Savior;
        Thy grace and boundless favor
        Stand fast forevermore.

        1. See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph;
        1. See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph;
        See the King in royal state,
        Riding on the clouds, His chariot,
        To His heavenly palace gate!
        Hark, the choirs of angel voices
        Joyful alleluias sing,
        And the portals high are lifted
        To receive their heavenly King.

        2. Who is this that comes in glory
        With the trump of jubilee?
        Lord of battles, God of armies,--
        He hath gained the victory.
        He who on the cross did suffer,
        He who from the grave arose,
        He hath vanquished sin and Satan;
        He by death hath spoiled His foes.

        3. While He lifts His hands in blessing,
        He is parted from His friends;
        While their eager eyes behold Him,
        He upon the clouds ascends.
        He who walked with God and pleased Him,
        Preaching truth and doom to come,
        He, our Enoch, is translated
        To His everlasting home.

        4. Now our heavenly Aaron enters
        With His blood within the veil;
        Joshua now is come to Canaan,
        And the kings before Him quail.
        Now He plants the tribes of Israel
        In their promised resting-place;
        Now our great Elijah offers
        Double portion of His grace.

        5. Thou hast raised our human nature
        On the clouds to God's right hand;
        There we sit in heavenly places,
        There with Thee in glory stand.
        Jesus reigns, adored by angels;
        Man with God is on the throne.
        Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension
        We by faith behold our own.

        6. Glory be to God the Father;
        Glory be to God the Son,
        Dying, risen, ascending for us,
        Who the heavenly realm hath won.
        Glory to the Holy Spirit!
        To One God in Persons Three
        Glory both in earth and heaven,
        Glory, endless glory, be.

        1. The Head that once was crowned with thorns
        1. The Head that once was crowned with thorns
        Is crowned with glory now;
        A royal diadem adorns
        The mighty Victor's brow.

        2. The highest place that heaven affords
        Is His, is His by right,
        The King of kings and Lord of lords,
        And heaven's eternal Light;

        3. The Joy of all who dwell above,
        The Joy of all below
        To whom He manifests His love
        And grants His name to know.

        4. To them the cross, with all its shame,
        With all its grace, is given;
        Their name an everlasting name,
        Their joy the joy of heaven.

        5. They suffer with their Lord below,
        They reign with Him above,
        Their profit and their joy to know
        The mystery of His love.

        6. The cross He bore is life and health,
        Though shame and death to Him:
        His people's hope, His people's wealth,
        Their everlasting theme.

        1. Jesus, my great High Priest,
        1. Jesus, my great High Priest,
        Offered His blood and died;
        My guilty conscience seeks
        No sacrifice beside.
        His powerful blood did once atone,
        And now it pleads before the throne.

        2. To this dear Surety's hand
        Will I commit my cause;
        He answers and fulfils
        His Father's broken laws.
        Behold my soul at freedom set;
        My Surety paid the dreadful debt.

        3. My Advocate appears
        For my defense on high;
        The Father bows His ears
        And lays His thunder by.
        Not all that hell or sin can say
        Shall turn His heart, His love, away.

        4. Should all the hosts of death
        And powers of hell unknown
        Put their most dreadful forms
        Of rage and mischief on,
        I shall be safe, for Christ displays
        Superior power and guardian grace.

        1. Hark! ten thousand harps and voices
        1. Hark! ten thousand harps and voices
        Sound the note of praise above;
        Jesus reigns, and heaven rejoices,--
        Jesus reigns, the God of Love.
        See, He sits on yonder throne;
        Jesus rules the world alone.

        2. Come, ye saints, unite your praises
        With the angels round His throne;
        Soon, we hope, our God will raise us
        To the place where He is gone.
        Meet it is that we should sing,
        "Glory, glory, to our King!"

        3. Sing how Jesus came from heaven,
        How He bore the cross below,
        How all power to Him is given,
        How He reigns in glory now;
        'Tis a great and endless theme,
        Oh, 'tis sweet to sing of Him!

        4. Jesus, hail! Thy glory brightens
        All above and gives it worth;
        Lord of Life, Thy smile enlightens,
        Cheers,  and charms Thy saints on earth.
        When we think of love like Thine,
        Lord, we own it love divine.

        5. King of Glory, reign forever;
        Thine an everlasting crown.
        Nothing from Thy love shall sever
        Those whom Thou hast made Thine own,
        Happy objects of Thy grace,
        Destined to behold Thy face.


        6. Savior, hasten Thine appearing;
        Bring, oh, bring, the glorious day
        When, the awe-full summons hearing,
        Heaven and earth shall pass away;
        Then with golden harps we'll sing,
        "Glory, glory, to our King!"

        1. Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
        1. Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
        See the Man of Sorrows now!
        From the fight returned victorious,
        Every knee to Him shall bow.
        Crown Him! Crown Him!
        Crowns become the Victor's brow.

        2. Crown the Savior! Angels, crown Him!
        Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
        On the seat of power enthrone Him
        While the vault of heaven rings.
        Crown Him! Crown Him!
        Crown the Savior King of kings.

        3. Sinners in derision crowned Him,
        Mocking thus the Savior's claim;
        Saints and angels crowd around Him,
        Own His title, praise His name.
        Crown Him! Crown Him!
        Spread abroad the Victor's fame!

        4. Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
        Hark, those loud triumphant chords!
        Jesus takes the highest station;
        Oh, what joy the sight affords!
        Crown Him! Crown Him!
        King of kings and Lord of lords!

        1. We thank Thee, Jesus, dearest Friend,
        1. We thank Thee, Jesus, dearest Friend,
        That Thou didst into heaven ascend.
        O blessed Savior, bid us live
        And strength to soul and body give.
        Hallelujah!

        2. Ascended to His throne on high,
        Hid from our sight, yet always nigh;
        He rules and reigns at God's right hand
        And has all power at His command.
        Hallelujah!

        3. The man who trusts in Him is blest
        And finds in Him eternal rest;
        This world's allurements we despise
        And fix on Christ alone our eyes.
        Hallelujah!

        4. We therefore heartily rejoice
        And sing His praise with cheerful voice;
        He captive led captivity,
        From bitter death He set us free.
        Hallelujah!

        5. Through Him we heirs of heaven are made;
        O Brother, Christ, extend Thine aid
        That we may firmly trust in Thee
        And through Thee live eternally.
        Hallelujah!

        1. Come, Holy Ghost, God and Lord!
        1. Come, Holy Ghost, God and Lord!
        Be all Thy graces now out poured
        On each believer's mind and heart;
        Thy fervent love to them impart.
        Lord, by the brightness of Thy light,
        Thou in the faith dost men unite
        Of every land and every tongue;
        This to Thy praise, O Lord, our God, be sung.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        2. Thou holy Light, Guide Divine,
        Oh, cause the Word of Life to shine!
        Teach us to know our God aright
        And call Him Father with delight.
        From every error keep us free;
        Let none but Christ our Master be
        That we in living faith abide,
        In Him, our Lord, with all our might confide.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        3. Thou holy Fire, Comfort true,
        Grant us the will Thy work to do
        And in Thy service to abide;
        Let trials turn us not aside.
        Lord, by Thy power prepare each heart
        And to our weakness strength impart
        That bravely here we may contend,
        Through life and death to Thee, our Lord, ascend.
        Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

        1. Come, Holy Spirit, Come!
        1. Come, Holy Spirit, Come!
        Let Thy bright beams arise;
        Dispel the sorrow from our minds,
        The darkness from our eyes.

        2. Revive our drooping faith,
        Our doubts and fears remove,
        And kindle in our breasts the flame
        Of never-dying love.

        3. Convince us of our sin,
        Then lead to Jesus blood,
        And to our wondering view reveal
        The mercies of our God.

        4. 'Tis Thine to cleanse the heart,
        To sanctify the soul,
        To pour fresh life into each part,
        And new-create the whole.

        5. Dwell, therefore, in our hearts;
        Our minds from bondage free;
        Then shall we know and praise and love
        The Father, Son, and Thee.

        1. Come, oh, come, Thou quickening Spirit,
        1. Come, oh, come, Thou quickening Spirit,
        God from all eternity!
        May Thy power never fail us;
        Dwell within us constantly.
        Then shall truth and life and light
        Banish all the gloom of night.

        2. Grant our hearts in fullest measure
        Wisdom, counsel, purity,
        That they ever may be seeking
        Only that which pleaseth Thee.
        Let Thy knowledge spread and grow,
        Working error's overthrow.

        3. Show us, Lord, the path of blessing;
        When we trespass on our way,
        Cast, O Lord, our sins behind Thee
        And be with us day by day.
        Should we stray, O Lord, recall;
        Work repentance when we fall.

        4. With our spirit bear Thou witness
        That we are the sons of God
        Who rely upon Him solely
        When we pass beneath the rod;
        For we know, as children should,
        That the cross is for our good.

        5. Prompt us, Lord, to come before Him
        With a childlike heart to pray;
        Sigh in us, O Holy Spirit,
        When we know not what to say.
        Then our prayer is not in vain,
        And our faith new strength shall gain.

        6. If our soul can find no comfort
        And despondency grows strong
        That the heart cries out in anguish:
        "O my God, how long, how long?"
        Comfort then the aching breast,
        Grant us courage, patience, rest.

        7. Holy Spirit, strong and mighty.
        Thou who makest all things new,
        Make Thy work within us perfect
        And the evil Foe subdue.
        Grant us weapons for the strife
        And with victory crown our life.

        8. Guard, O God, our faith forever;
        Let not Satan, death, or shame
        Ever part us from our Savior;
        Lord our Refuge is Thy name.
        Though our flesh cry ever: Nay!
        Be Thy Word to us still Yea!

        9. And when life's frail thread is breaking.

        Glory of the saints at rest.

        Cheer us this hour.

        On our dark souls to shine
        And make us blest.

        4. Exalt our low desires,
        Extinguish passion's fires,
        Heal every wound.

        Our devious steps attend
        While heavenward bound.

        5. Come, all the faithful bless;
        Let all who Christ confess
        His praise employ.

        A second birth more blest.

        Though here to dwell Thou deignest,
        Forever equal reignest,
        Art equally adored.

        2. Oh, enter, let me know Thee
        And feel Thy power within,
        The power that breaks our fetters
        And rescues us from sin;

        That I may serve Thee truly
        And render honor duly
        With perfect heart to Thee.

        3. Thou art, O Holy Spirit,
        The true anointing Oil,
        Through which are consecrated
        Soul, body, rest, and toil
        To Christ, whose guardian wings,
        Where'er their lot appointed,
        Protect His own anointed,
        His prophets, priests, and kings.

        4. Thou, Holy Spirit, teachest
        The soul to pray aright;
        Thy songs have sweetest music,

        They pierce the highest heaven
        Till He His help hath given
        Who surely helpeth all.

        5. Thy gift is joy, O Spirit,
        Thou wouldst not have us pine;
        In darkest hours Thy comfort
        Doth ever brightly shine.

        Hath shed its sweetness o'er me
        And opened heaven before me
        And bid my heart rejoice!

        6. All love is Thine, O Spirit;
        Thou hatest enmity;
        Thou lovest peace and friendship,
        All strife wouldst have us flee;
        Where wrath and discord reign,
        Thy whisper kindly pleadeth
        And to the heart that heedeth
        Brings love and light again.

        7. Our path in all things order
        According to Thy mind,
        And when this life is over
        And all must be resigned,
        Oh, grant us then to die
        With calm and fearless spirit
        And after death inherit
        Eternal life on high.

        That is the firmest ground of faith.

        6. Glory to God the Father, Son,
        And Holy Spirit, Three in One!
        To Thee, O blessed Trinity,
        Be praise now and eternally!

        1. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
        1. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
        Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
        Holy holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
        God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

        2. Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
        Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
        Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
        Which wert and art and evermore shalt be.

        3. Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
        Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,
        Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
        Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

        4. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
        All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea.
        Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
        God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

        1. God the Father, be our Stay,
        1. God the Father, be our Stay,
        Oh, let us perish never.
        Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
        And grant us life forever.
        Keep us from the Evil One;
        Uphold our faith most holy,
        Grant us to trust Thee solely
        With humble hearts and lowly.
        Let us put God's armor on:
        With all true Christians running
        Our heavenly race and shunning
        The devil's wiles and cunning.
        Amen, Amen, this be done,
        So sing we, Hallelujah!

        2. Jesus Christ, be Thou our Stay,
        Oh, let us perish never.
        Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
        And grant us life forever.
        Keep us from the Evil One;
        Uphold our faith most holy,
        Grant us to trust Thee solely
        With humble hearts and lowly.
        Let us put God's armor on:
        With all true Christians running
        Our heavenly race and shunning
        The devil's wiles and cunning.
        Amen, Amen, this be done,
        So sing we, Hallelujah!

        3. Holy Ghost, be Thou our Stay,
        Oh, let us perish never.
        Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
        And grant us life forever.
        Keep us from the Evil One;
        Uphold our faith most holy,
        Grant us to trust Thee solely
        With humble hearts and lowly.
        Let us put God's armor on:
        With all true Christians running
        Our heavenly race and shunning
        The devil's wiles and cunning.
        Amen, Amen, this be done,
        So sing we, Hallelujah!

        1. Father of glory, to Thy name
        1. Father of glory, to Thy name
        Immortal praise we give,
        Who dost an act of grace proclaim
        And bid us rebels live.

        2. Immortal honor to the Son,
        Who makes Thine anger cease;
        Our lives He ransomed with His own
        And died to make our peace.

        3. To Thine almighty Spirit be
        Immortal glory given,
        Whose teachings bring us near to Thee
        And train us up for heaven.

        4. Let men with their united voice
        Adore the eternal God
        And spread His honors and their joys
        Through nations far abroad.

        5. Let faith and love and duty join
        One grateful song to raise;
        Let saints in earth and heaven combine
        In harmony and praise.

        1. Isaiah, mighty seer, in days of old
        1. Isaiah, mighty seer, in days of old
        The Lord of all in Spirit did behold
        High on a lofty throne, in splendor bright,
        With flowing train that filled the Temple quite.
        Above the throne were stately seraphim,
        Six wings had they, these messengers of Him.
        With twain they veiled their faces, as was meet,
        With twain in reverent awe they hid their feet,
        And with the other twain aloft they soared,
        One to the other called and praised the Lord:
        "Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
        Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
        Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
        Behold, His glory filleth all the earth!"
        The beams and lintels trembled at the cry,
        And clouds of smoke enwrapped the throne on high.

        1. Holy God, we praise thy name;
        1. Holy God, we praise thy name;
        Lord of all, we bow before Thee.
        All on earth Thy scepter claim,
        All in heaven above adore Thee.
        Infinite Thy vast domain,
        Everlasting is Thy reign.

        2. Hark! the glad celestial hymn
        Angel choirs above are raising;
        Cherubim and seraphim,
        In unceasing chorus praising,
        Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
        Holy, holy, holy, Lord!

        3. Lo, the apostles holy train
        Join Thy sacred name to hallow;
        Prophets swell the glad refrain,
        And the white-robed martyrs follow,
        And from morn to set of sun
        Through the Church the song goes on.

        4. Holy Father, holy Son,
        Holy Spirit, three we name Thee;
        Though in essence only one,
        Undivided God we claim Thee
        And, adoring, bend the knee
        While we own the mystery.

        1. We All Believe in One True God
        1. We All Believe in One True God
        Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        Ever-present Help in need,
        Praised by all the heavenly host,
        By whose mighty power alone
        All is made and wrought and done.

        2. We all belive in Jesus Christ,
        Son of God and Mary's Son,
        Who descended from His thrones
        And for us salvation won;
        By whose cross and death are we
        Rescued from all misery.

        3. We all confess the Holy Ghost,
        Who from both fore'er proceeds;
        Who uphold and comforts us
        In all trials, fears,and needs.
        Blest and holy Trinity,
        Praise forever be to Thee!

        Who uphold and comforts us
        In all trials, fears,and needs.
        Blest and holy Trinity,
        Praise forever be to Thee!

        1. In one true God we all believe
        1. In one true God we all believe
        And to His name all glory give.
        Creator of all things is He
        In the heaven, the earth, the sea.

        2. We all believe in God's own Son,
        Our Lord, the Sole-begotten One;
        And by the Holy Ghost the same
        Of a virgin man became.

        3. By Pontius Pilate crucified,
        He suffered on the Tree and died;
        To show of Satan's reign the end,
        He did into hell descend.

        4. The same Lord Christ of Nazareth
        Who for all sinners tasted death
        The third day after He had died
        Rose with body glorified.

        5. In full accord with God's own Word
        This holy body of our Lord,
        Although in death's grim grasp it be,
        Never would corruption see.

        6. He then ascended into heaven,
        Where endless power to Him was given;
        And there for us in all our needs
        Graciously He intercedes.

        7. From thence He'll come, as once He said,
        To judge the living and the dead.
        O righteous Judge, our Savior, come,
        Take us to our heavenly home!

        8. We all confess the Holy Ghost,
        Who guides the Church, a chosen host,
        And binds the saints in purest love
        Here on earth and there above.

        9. And to this truth we also cleave,
        That we forgiveness do receive,
        True peace and joy and comfort sweet,
        Daily from the Paraclete.

        10. From death our bodies shall arise
        To endless life beyond the skies;
        By grace through Jesus we shall rest
        There in heaven, forever blest.

        1. Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,
        1. Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,
        Filled with celestial virtue and light,
        These that, where night never followeth day,
        Praise the Thrice Holy One ever and aye.

        2. These are Thy ministers, these dost Thou own,
        Lord God of Sabaoth, nearest Thy throne;
        These are Thy messengers, these dost Thou send,
        Help of the helpless ones, man to defend.

        3. Then, when the earth was first poised in mid space,
        Then, when the planets first sped on their race,
        Then, when were ended the six days employ,
        Then all the sons of God shouted for joy.

        4. Still let them succor us, still let them fight,
        Lord of angelic hosts, battling for right,
        Till, where their anthems they ceaselessly pour,
        We with the angels may bow and adore. Amen.

	1. Around the throne of God a band
	1. Around the throne of God a band
	Of glorious angels ever stand;
	Bright things they see sweet harps they hold,
	And on their heads are crowns of gold.
	
	2. Some wait around Him, ready still
	To sing His praise and do His will;
	And some, when He commands them, go
	To guard His servants here below.
	
	3. Lord, give Thy angels every day
	Command to guide us on our way
	And bid them every evening keep
	Their watch around us while we sleep.
	
	4. So shall no wicked thing draw near
	To do us harm or cause us fear;
	And we shall dwell, when life is past,
	With angels round Thy throne at last.

        1. Jesus, Brightness of the Father,
        1. Jesus, Brightness of the Father,
        Life and Strength of all who live,
        For creating guardian angels
        Glory to Thy name we give
        And Thy wondrous praise rehearse,
        Singing in harmonious verse.
        
        2. Blessed Lord, by their protection
        Shelter us from harm this day,
        Keep us pure in flesh and spirit,
        Save us from the Foe, we pray,
        And vouchsafe us by Thy grace
        In Thy Paradise a place.
        
        3. Glory to the almighty Father
        Sing we with the heavenly host;
        Glory to the great Redeemer,
        Glory to the Holy Ghost;
        Three in one and One in Three,
        Throughout all eternity!

        1. Lord of our life and God of our salvation.
        1. Lord of our life and God of our salvation.
        Star of our night and Hope of every nation,
        Hear and receive Thy Church's supplication,
        Lord God Almighty.
        
        2. See round Thine ark the hungry billows curling;
        See how thy foes their banners are unfurling.
        Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,
        Thou canst preserve us.
        
        3. Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
        Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
        Lord, o'er Thy Church nor death nor hell prevaileth;
        Grant us Thy peace, Lord:
        
        4. Peace in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging;
        Peace in Thy Church where brothers are engaging;
        Peace when the world its busy war is waging.
        Calm Thy foes raging.
        
        5. Grant us Thy help till backward they are driven;
        Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;
        Grant peace on earth or, after we have striven,
        Peace in Thy heaven.

        1. Flung to the heedless winds
        1. Flung to the heedless winds
        Or on the waters cast,
        The martyrs ashes, watched,
        Shall gathered be at last.
        And from that scattered dust,
        Around us and abroad,
        Shall spring a plenteous seed
        Of witnesses for God.

        2. The Father hath received
        Their latest living breath,
        And vain is Satan's boast
        Of victory in their death.
        Still, still, though dead, they speak,
        And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim
        To many a wakening land
        The one availing Name.

        1. O Lord, look down from heaven, behold
        1. O Lord, look down from heaven, behold
        And let Thy pity waken:
        How few are we within Thy Fold,
        Thy saints by men forsaken!
        True faith seems quenched on every hand,
        Men suffer not Thy Word to stand;
        Dark times have us o'ertaken.

        2. With fraud which they themselves invent
        Thy truth they have confounded;
        Their hearts are not with one consent
        On Thy pure doctrine grounded.
        While they parade with outward show,
        They lead the people to and fro,
        In error's maze astounded.

        3. May God root out all heresy
        And of false teachers rid us
        Who proudly say: "Now, where is he
        That shall our speech forbid us?
        By right or might we shall prevail;
        What we determine cannot fail;
        We own no lord and master."

        4. Therefore saith God, "I must arise,
        The poor My help are needing;
        To Me ascend My people's cries,
        And I have heard their pleading.
        For them My saving Word shall fight
        And fearlessly and sharply smite,
        The poor with might defending."

        5. As silver tried by fire is pure
        From all adulteration,
        So through God's Word shall men endure
        Each trial and temptation.
        Its light beams brighter through the cross,
        And, purified from human dross,
        It shines through every nation.

        6. Thy truth defend, O God, and stay
        This evil generation;
        And from the error of their way
        Keep Thine own congregation.
        The wicked everywhere abound
        And would Thy little flock confound;
        But Thou art our Salvation.

        1. Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word;
        1. Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word;
        Curb those who fain by craft and sword
        Would wrest the Kingdom from Thy Son
        And set at naught all He hath done.


        2. Lord Jesus Christ, Thy power make known,
        For Thou art Lord of lords alone;
        Defend Thy Christendom that we
        May evermore sing praise to Thee.


        3. O Comforter of priceless worth.
        Send peace and unity on earth.
        Support us in our final strife
        And lead us out of death to life.

        1. A mighty Fortress is our God,
        1. A mighty Fortress is our God,
        A trusty Shield and Weapon;
        He helps us free from every need
        That hath us now o'ertaken.
        The old evil Foe
        Now means deadly woe;
        Deep guile and great might
        Are his dread arms in fight;
        On Earth is not his equal.

        2. With might of ours can naught be done,
        Soon were our loss effected;
        But for us fights the Valiant One,
        Whom God Himself elected.
        Ask ye, Who is this?
        Jesus Christ it is.
        Of Sabaoth Lord,
        And there's none other God;
        He holds the field forever.

        3. Though devils all the world should fill,
        All eager to devour us.
        We tremble not, we fear no ill,
        They shall not overpower us.
        This world's prince may still
        Scowl fierce as he will,
        He can harm us none,
        He's judged; the deed is done;
        One little word can fell him.

        4. The Word they still shall let remain
        Nor any thanks have for it;
        He's by our side upon the plain
        With His good gifts and Spirit.
        And take they our life,
        Goods, fame, child and wife,
        Let these all be gone,
        They yet have nothing won;
        The Kingdom our remaineth.

        1. 0 little flock, fear not the Foe
        1. 0 little flock, fear not the Foe
        Who madly seeks your overthrow;
        Dread not his rage and power.
        What though your courage sometimes faints,
        His seeming triumph o'er God's saints
        Lasts but a little hour.
        
        2. Be of good cheer; your cause belongs
        To Him who can avenge your wrongs;
        Leave it to Him, our Lord.
        Though hidden yet from mortal eyes,
        His Gideon shall for you arise,
        Uphold you and His Word.
        
        3. As true as God's own Word is true.
        Not earth nor hell with all their crew
        Against us shall prevail.
        A jest and byword are they grown;
        God is with us, we are His own;
        Our victory cannot fail.
        
        4. Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer;
        Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare,
        Fight for us once again!
        So shall Thy saints and martyrs raise
        A mighty chorus to Thy praise,
        World without end. Amen.

        1. Thine honor save, O Christ, our Lord!
        1. Thine honor save, O Christ, our Lord!
        Hear Zion's cries and help afford;
        Destroy the wiles of mighty foes
        Who now Thy Word and truth oppose.

        2. Their craft and pomp indeed are great,
        And of their power thy boast and prate;
        Our hope they scornfully deride
        And deem us nothing in their pride.

        3. Forgive, O Lord, our sins forgive;
        Grant us Thy grace and let us live.
        Convince Thy foes throughout the land
        That godless counsels shall not stand.

        4. That Thou art with us, Lord, proclaim
        And put our enemies to shame;
        Confound them in their haughtiness
        And help Thine own in their distress.

        5. Preserve Thy little flock in peace,
        Nor let Thy boundless mercy cease;
        To all the world let it appear
        That Thy true Church indeed is here.

        1. If God had not been on our side
        1. If God had not been on our side
        And had not come to aid us,
        The foes with all their power and pride
        Would surely have dismayed us;
        For we, His flock, would have to fear
        The threat of men both far and near
        Who rise in might against us.

        2. Their furious wrath, did God permit,
        Would surely have consumed us
        And as a deep and yawning pit
        With life and limb entombed us.
        Like men o'er whom dark waters roll
        Their wrath would have engulfed our soul
        And, like a flood, o'erwhelmed us.

        3. Blest be the Lord, who foiled their threat
        That they could not devour us;
        Our souls, like birds, escaped their net,
        They could not overpower us.
        The snare is boken-we are free!
        Our help is ever, Lord, in Thee,
        Who madest earth and heaven.

        1. Zion mourns in fear and anguish,
        1. Zion mourns in fear and anguish,
        Zion, city of our God.
        "Ah," she says, "how sore I languish,
        Bowed beneath the chastening rod!
        For my God forsook me quite
        And forgot my sorry plight
        Mid these troubles now distressing,
        Countless woes my soul oppressing.

        2. "Once," she mourns, "He promised plainly
        That His help should e'er be near;
        Yet I now must seek Him vainly
        In my days of woe and fear.
        Will His anger never cease?
        Will He not renew His peace?
        Will He not show forth compassion
        And again forgive transgression?"

        3. "Zion, surely I do love thee,"
        Thus to her the Savior saith,
        "Though with many woes I prove thee
        And thy soul is sad to death.
        For My troth is pledged to thee;
        Zion, thou art dear to Me.
        Deep within My heart I've set thee,
        That I never can forget thee.

        4. "Let not Satan make thee craven;
        He can threaten, but not harm.
        On My hands thy name is graven,
        And thy shield is My strong arm.
        How, then, could it ever be
        I should not remember thee,
        Fail to build thy wall, My city,
        And look down on thee with pity?

        5. "Ever shall Mine eyes behold thee;
        On My bosom thou art laid.
        Ever shall My love enfold thee;
        Never shalt thou lack Mine aid.
        Neither Satan, war, nor stress
        Then shall mar thy happiness:
        With this blessed consolation
        Be thou firm in tribulation."

        1. O  Lord, our Father, shall we be confounded
        1. O  Lord, our Father, shall we be confounded
        Who, though by trials and by woes surrounded,
        On Thee alone for help are still relying,
        To Thee are crying?

        2. Lord, put to shame Thy foes who breathe defiance
        And vainly make their might their sole reliance;
        In mercy turn to us, the poor and stricken,
        Our hope to quicken.

        3. Be Thou our Helper and our strong Defender;
        Speak to our foes and cause them to surrender.
        Yea, long before their plans have been completed,
        They are defeated.

        4. 'Tis vain to trust in man; for Thou, Lord, only
        Art the Defense and Comfort of the lonely.
        With Thee to lead, the battle shall be glorious
        And we victorious.

        5. Thou art our Hero, all our foes subduing;
        Save Thou Thy little flock they are pursuing.
        We seek Thy help; for Jesus sake be near us.
        Great Helper, hear us!

        1. Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult
        Of our life's wild, restless sea,
        Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
        Saying, "Christian, follow Me."
        
        2. As of old Saint Andrew heard it
        By the Galilean lake,
        Turned from home and toil and kindred.
        Leaving all for His dear sake.
        
        3. Jesus calls us from the worship
        Of the vain world's golden stole.
        From each idol that would keep us,
        Saying, "Christian, love Me more."
        
        4. In our joys and in our sorrows,
        Days of toll and hours of ease,
        Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
        "Christian, love Me more than these."
        
        5. Jesus calls us; by Thy mercies,
        Savior, make us hear Thy call,
        Give our hearts to Thine obedience,
        Serve and love Thee best of all. Amen.

        1. Sweet flowerets of the martyr band,
        Plucked by the tyrant's ruthless hand
        Upon the threshold of the morn,
        Like rosebuds by a tempest torn;
        
        2. First victims for the incarnate Lord,
        A tender flock to feel the sword;
        Beside the very altar gay,
        With palm and crown, ye seemed to play.
        
        3. Ah, what availed King Herod's wrath?
        He could not stop the Savior's path.
        Alone, while others murdered lay,
        In safety Christ is borne away.
        
        4. 0 Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee

        2. The Prophet gave the sign
        For faithful men to read:
        A virgin, born of David's line,
        Shall bear the promised Seed.
        
        3. Ask not how this should be,
        But worship and adore
        Like her whom God's own majesty
        Came down to shadow o'er.

        To hear the gracious word,
        Mary, the pure and lowly maid,
        The favored of the Lord.

        And songs at break of day.

        And stronger than the strong.
        
        4. And whosoever cometh,
        I will not cast him out."
        O patient love of Jesus,
        Which drives away our doubt,
        Which, though we be unworthy
        Of love so great and free,
        Invites us very sinners
        To come, dear Lord, to Thee!
        
        1. I heard the voice of Jesus say,

        "Come unto Me and rest;
        Lay down, thou weary one, lay down,
        Thy head upon My breast."
        I came to Jesus as I was,
        Weary and worn and sad;
        I found in Him a resting-place,
        And He has made me glad.
        
        2. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
        "Behold, I freely give
        The living water; thirsty one,
        Stoop down and drink and live."
        I came to Jesus, and I drank
        Of that life-giving stream.
        My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
        And now I live in Him.
        
        3. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
        "I am this dark world's Light.
        Look unto Me; thy morn shall rise
        And all thy day be bright."
        I looked to Jesus, and I found
        In Him my Star, my Sun;
        And in that Light of Life I'll walk
        Till traveling days are done.

        3. Delay not, delay not! The Spirit of Grace,
        Long grieved and resisted, may take His sad flight
        And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race,

        4. Delay not, delay not! The hour is at hand;
        The earth shall dissolve, and the heavens shall fade.

          2. See the rivers four that gladden
          With their streams the better Eden,

          Drink and find salvation here.

          3. Here our souls, by Jesus sated,

          Soaring on angelic pinion,
          They shall reach the Source of love.

          4. Then shall thanks and praise ascending
          For Thy mercies without ending
          Rise to Thee, O Savior blest.

        1. How precious is the Book Divine,
        1. How precious is the Book Divine,
        By inspiration given!
        Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine

        Its radiant beams are cast;
        A light whose never weary ray
        Grows brightest at the last.

        In this dark vale of tears,
        Life, light, and joy it still imparts
        And quells our rising fears.

        6. This lamp through all the tedious night
        Of life shall guide our way
        Till we behold the clearer light
        Of an eternal day.

        The earth maintains her place;
        And these Thy servants, night and day,
        Thy skill and power express.

        4. But still Thy Law and Gospel, Lord,
        Have lessons more divine;
        Not earth stands firmer than Thy Word,
        Nor stars so nobly shine.

        5. Thy Word is everlasting truth;
        How pure is every page!
        That holy Book shall guide our youth
        And well support our age.

        1. That man a Godly life might live,
        1. That man a Godly life might live,
        God did these Ten Commandments give
        By His true servant Moses, high
        Upon the Mount Sinai.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        2. I am thy God and Lord alone,
        No other God beside Me own;
        Put thy whole confidence in Me
        And love Me e'er cordially.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        3. By idle word and speech profane
        Take not My holy name in vain
        And praise but that as good and true
        Which I Myself say and do.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        4. Hallow the day which God hath blest
        That thou and all thy house may rest;
        Keep hand and heart from labor free
        That God may so work in thee.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        5. Give to thy parents honor due,
        Be dutiful, and loving, too,
        And help them when their strength decays,
        So shalt thou have length of days.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        6. In sinful wrath thou shalt not kill
        Nor hate nor render ill for ill;
        Be patient and of gentle mood,
        And to thy foe do thou good.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        7. Be faithful to thy marriage vows,
        Thy heart give only to thy spouse;
        Thy life keep pure, and lest thou sin,
        Use temperance and discipline.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        8. Steal not; all usury abhor
        Nor wring their life-blood from the poor,

        To all the poor in the land.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        9. Bear not false witness nor belie
        Thy neighbor by foul calumny.
        Defend his innocence from blame;
        With charity hide his shame.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        10. Thy neighbor's house desire thou not,
        His wife, nor aught that he hath got,
        But wish that his such good may be
        As thy heart doth wish for thee.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        11. God these commandments gave therein
        11. God these commandments gave therein
        To show thee, child of man, thy sin
        And make thee also well perceive
        How man unto God should live.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        12. Help us, Lord Jesus Christ, for we
        A Mediator have in Thee;
        Our works cannot salvation gain;
        Thy merit but endless pain.
        Have mercy, Lord!

        1. Lord, help us ever to retain
        1. Lord, help us ever to retain
        The Catechism's doctrine plain
        As Luther taught the Word of Truth
        In simple style to tender youth.

        2. Help us Thy holy Law to learn,
        To mourn our sin, and from it turn
        In faith to Thee and to Thy Son
        And Holy Spirit, Three in One.

        3. Hear us, dear Father, when we pray
        For needed help from day to day
        That as Thy children we may live,
        Whom Thou in Baptism didst receive.

        4. Lord, when we fall and sin doth stain,
        Absolve and lift us up again;
        And through the Sacrament increase
        Our faith till we depart in peace.

        1. The Law commands and makes us know
        1. The Law commands and makes us know
        What duties to our God we owe;
        But 'tis the Gospel must reveal
        Where lies our strength to do his will.

        2. The Law discovers guilt and sin
        And shows how vile our hearts have been;
        The Gospel only can express
        Forgiving love and cleansing grace.

        3. What curses doth the Law denounce
        Against the man who fails but once!
        But in the Gospel Christ appears,
        Pardoning the guilt of numerous years.

        4. My soul, no more attempt to draw
        Thy life and comfort from the Law
        Fly to the hope the Gospel gives;
        The man that trusts the promise lives.

        1. We have a sure prophetic Word
        1. We have a sure prophetic Word
        By inspiration of the Lord;
        And though assailed on every hand,
        Jehovah's Word shall ever stand.

        2. By powers of empire banned and burned,
        By pagan pride rejected, spurned,
        The Word still stands the Christian's trust
        While haughty empires lie in dust.

        3. Lo, what the Word in times of old
        Of future days and deeds foretold
        Is all fulfilled while ages roll,
        As traced on the prophetic scroll.

        4. Abiding, steadfast, firm, and sure,
        The teachings of the Word endure.
        Blest he who trusts this steadfast Word;
        His anchor holds in Christ, the Lord.

        1. Lamp of our feet whereby we trace
        1. Lamp of our feet whereby we trace
        Our path when wont to stray;
        Stream from the fount of heavenly grace,
        Brook by the traveler's way.

        2. Bread of our souls whereon we feed,
        True manna from on high;
        Our guide and chart wherein we read
        Of realms beyond the sky;

        3. Pillar of fire, through watches dark,
        Or radiant cloud by day;
        When waves would break our tossing bark,
        Our anchor and our stay;

        4. Word of the ever-living God,
        Will of His glorious Son;
        Without thee, how could earth be trod
        Or heaven itself be won?

        5. Lord, grant us all aright to learn
        The wisdom it imparts
        And to its heavenly teaching turn
        With simple, childlike hearts.

        1. Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide,
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide,
        For round us falls the eventide;
        Nor let Thy Word, that heavenly light,
        For us be ever veiled in night.

        2. In these last days of sore distress
        Grant us, dear Lord, true steadfastness
        That pure we keep, till life is spent,
        Thy holy Word and Sacrament.

        3. Lord Jesus, help, Thy Church uphold,
        For we are sluggish, thoughtless, cold.
        Oh, prosper well Thy Word of grace
        And spread its truth in every place!

        4. Oh, keep us in Thy Word, we pray;
        The guile and rage of Satan stay!
        Oh, may Thy mercy never cease!
        Give concord, patience, courage, peace.

        5. O God, how sin's dread works abound!
        Throughout the earth no rest is found,
        And falsehood's spirit wide has spread,
        And error boldly rears its head.

        6. The haughty spirits, Lord, restrain
        Who o'er Thy Church with might would reign
        And always set forth something new,
        Devised to change Thy doctrine true.

        7. And since the cause and glory, Lord,
        Are Thine, not ours, to us afford
        Thy help and strength and constancy.
        With all our heart we trust in Thee.

        8. A trusty weapon is Thy Word,
        Thy Church's buckler, shield and sword.
        Oh, let us in its power confide
        That we may seek no other guide!

        9. Oh, grant that in Thy holy Word
        We here may live and die, dear Lord;
        And when our journey endeth here,
        Receive us into glory there.

        1. O Holy Spirit, grant us grace
        1. O Holy Spirit, grant us grace
        That we our Lord and Savior
        In faith and fervent love embrace
        And truly serve Him ever,
        So that when death is drawing nigh,
        We to His open wounds may fly
        And find in them salvation.

        2. Help us that we Thy saving Word
        In faithful hearts may treasure;
        Let e'er that Bread of Life afford
        New grace in richest measure.
        Yea, let us die to every sin,
        For heaven create us new within
        That fruits of faith may flourish.

        3. And when our earthly race is run,
        Death's bitter hour impending,
        Then may Thy work in us begun
        Continue till life's ending,
        Until we gladly may commend
        Our souls into our Savior's hand
        To rest in peace eternal.

        1. O Word of God Incarnate,
        1. O Word of God Incarnate,
        O Wisdom from on high,
        O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
        O Light of our dark sky,
        We praise Thee for the radiance
        That from the hallowed page,
        A lantern to our footsteps
        Shines on from age to age.

        2. The Church from her dear Master
        Received the gift divine,
        And still that light she lifteth
        O'er all the earth to shine.
        It is the golden casket
        Where gems of truth are stored;
        It is the heaven-drawn picture
        Of Christ, the living Word.

        3. And when our earthly race is run,
        Death's bitter hour impending,
        Then may Thy work in us begun
        Continue till life's ending,
        Until we gladly may commend
        Our souls into our Savior's hand
        To rest in peace eternal.

        1. The Law of God is good and wise
        1. The Law of God is good and wise
        And sets His will before our eyes,
        Shows us the way of righteousness,
        And dooms to death when we transgress.

        2. Its light of holiness imparts
        The knowledge of our sinful hearts
        That we may see our lost estate
        And seek deliverance ere too late.

        3. To those who help in Christ have found
        And would in works of love abound
        It shows what deeds are His delight
        And should be done as food and right.

        4. When men the offered help disdain
        And wilfully in sin remain,
        Its terror in their ear resounds
        And keeps their wickedness in bounds.

        5. The Law is good; but since the Fall
        Its holiness condemns us all;
        It dooms us for our sin to die
        And has no power to justify.

        6. To Jesus we for refuge flee,
        Who from the curse has set us free,
        And humbly worship at His throne,
        Saved by His grace through faith alone.

        1. Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth,
        1. Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth,
        To Thy Word I now give heed;
        Life and spirit Thy Word beareth,
        All Thy Word is true indeed.
        Death's dread power in me is rife;
        Jesus, may Thy Word of Life
        Fill my soul with love's strong fervor
        That I cling to Thee forever.

        2. Oh, what blessing to be near Thee
        And to hearken to Thy voice!
        May I ever love and fear Thee
        That Thy Word may be my choice!
        Oft were hardened sinners, Lord,
        Struck with terror by Thy Word;
        But to him who for sin grieveth
        Comfort sweet and hope it giveth.

        3. Lord, Thy words are waters living
        Where I quench my thirsty need;
        Lord, Thy words are bread life-giving,
        On Thy words my Soul doth feed.
        Lord, Thy words shall be my light
        Through death's vale and dreary night;
        Yea, they are my sword prevailing
        And my cup of joy unfailing.

        4. Precious Jesus, I beseech Thee,
        May Thy words take root in me;
        May this gift from heaven enrich me
        So that I bear fruit for Thee!
        Take them never from my heart
        Till I see Thee as Thou art,
        When in heavenly bliss and glory
        I shall greet Thee and adore Thee.

        1. The Gospel shows the Father's grace,
        1. The Gospel shows the Father's grace,
        Who sent His Son to save our race,
        Proclaims how Jesus lived and died
        That man might thus be justified.

        2. It sets the Lamb before our eyes,
        Who made the atoning sacrifice,
        And call the souls with guilt opprest
        To come and find eternal rest.

        3. It brings the Savior's righteousness
        Our souls to robe in royal dress;
        From all our guilt it brings release
        And gives the troubled conscience peace.

        4. It is the power of God to save
        From sin and Satan and the grave;
        It works the faith, which firmly clings
        To all the treasures which it brings.

        5. It bears to all the tidings glad
        And bids their hearts no more be sad;
        The heavy-laden souls it cheers
        And banishes their guilty fears.

        6. May we in faith its tidings learn
        Nor thanklessly its blessings spurn;
        May we in faith its truth confess
        And praise the Lord our Righteousness!

        1. Baptized into Thy name most holy,
        1. Baptized into Thy name most holy,
        O Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
        I claim a place, though weak and lowly,
        Among Thy seed, Thy chosen host.
        Buried with Christ and dead to sin,
        Thy Spirit now shall live within.

        2. My loving Father, Thou dost take me
        To be henceforth Thy child and heir;
        My faithful Savior, Thou dost make me
        The fruit of all Thy sorrows share;
        Thou, Holy Ghost, wilt comfort me
        When darkest clouds around I see.

        3. And I have vowed to love and fear Thee
        And to obey Thee, Lord, alone;
        Because the Holy Ghost did move me,
        I dared to pledge myself Thine own,
        Renouncing sin to keep the faith
        And war with evil unto death.

        4. My faithful God, Thou failest never,
        Thy covenant surely will abide;
        Oh, cast me not away forever
        Should I transgress it on my side!
        Though I have oft my soul defiled,
        Do Thou forgive, restore, Thy child.

        5. Yea, all I am and love most dearly
        I offer now, O Lord, to Thee,
        Oh, let me make my vows sincerely
        And help me Thine own child to be!
        Let naught within me, naught I own,
        Serve any will but Thine alone.

        6. And never let my purpose falter,
        O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        But keep me faithful to Thine altar
        Till Thou shalt call me from my post,
        So unto Thee I live and die
        And praise Thee evermore on high.

        1. Dearest Jesus, we are here,
        1. Dearest Jesus, we are here,
        Gladly Thy command obeying;
        With this child we now draw near
        In accord with Thine own saying
        That to Thee it shall be given
        As a child and heir of heaven.

        2. Yea, Thy word is clear and plain,
        And we would obey it duly:
        "He who is not born again,
        Heart and life renewing truly,
        Born of water and the Spirit,
        Can My kingdom not inherit."

        3. Therefore hasten we to Thee,
        In our arms this infant bearing;
        Let us here Thy glory see
        Let this child, Thy mercy sharing,
        In Thine arms be shielded ever,
        Thine on earth and Thine forever.

        4. Gracious Head, Thy member own;
        Shepherd, take Thy lamb and feed it;
        Prince of Peace, make here Thy throne;
        Way of Life, to heaven lead it;
        Precious Vine, let nothing sever
        From Thy side this branch forever.

        5. Now into Thy heart we pour
        Prayers that from our hearts proceeded.
        Our petitions heavenward soar;
        May our warm desires be heeded!
        Write the name we now have given,
        Write it in the book of heaven.

        1. He that believes and is baptized
        1. He that believes and is baptized
        Shall see the Lord's salvation;
        Baptized into the death of Christ,
        He is a new creation.
        Through Christ's redemption he shall stand
        Among the glorious heavenly band
        Of every tribe and nation.

        2. With one accord, O God, we pray:
        Grant us Thy Holy Spirit;
        Look Thou on our infirmity
        Through Jesus blood and merit.
        Grant us to grow in grace each day
        That by this Sacrament we may
        Eternal life inherit.

        1. The Savior kindly calls
        1. The Savior kindly calls
        Our children to His breast;
        He folds them in His gracious arms,
        Himself declares them blest.

        2. "Let them approach," He cries,
        "Nor scorn their humble claim;
        The heirs of heaven are such as these,
        For such as these I came."

        3. With joy we bring them, Lord,
        Devoting them to Thee,
        Imploring that, as we are Thine,
        Thine may our offspring be.

        1. This child we dedicate to Thee,
        1. This child we dedicate to Thee,
        O God of grace and purity;
        Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
        And let Thy love its life prolong.

        2. Oh, may Thy Spirit gently draw
        Its willing soul to keep Thy Law!
        May virtue, piety, and truth
        Dawn even with its dawning youth!

        3. We, too, before Thy gracious sight
        Once shared the blest baptismal rite
        And would renew its solemn vow
        With love and thanks and praises now.

        4. Grant that with true and faithful heart
        We still may act the Christian's part,
        Cheered by each promise Thou hast given
        And laboring for the prize in heaven.

        1. An awe-full mystery is here
        1. An awe-full mystery is here
        To challenge faith and waken fear:
        The Savior comes as food divine,
        Concealed in earthly bread and wine.

        2. This world is loveless, -- but above,
        What wondrous boundlessness of love!
        The king of Glory stoops to me
        My spirit's life and strength to be.

        3. In consecrated wine and bread
        No eye perceives the mystery dread;
        But Jesus words are strong and clear:
        "My body and My blood are here."

        4. How dull are all the powers of sense
        Employed on proofs of love immense!
        The richest food remains unseen,
        And highest gifts appear -- how mean!

        5. But here we have no boon on earth,
        And faith alone discerns its worth:
        The Word, not sense, must be our guide,
        And faith assure, since sight's denied.

        6. Lord, show us still that Thou art good
        And grant us evermore this food.
        Give faith to every wavering soul
        And make each wounded spirit whole.

        1. Soul, adorn thyself with gladness,
        1. Soul, adorn thyself with gladness,
        Leave behind all gloom and sadness;
        Come into the daylight's splendor,
        There with joy thy praises render
        Unto Him whose grace unbounded
        Hath this woundrous supper founded.
        High o'er all the heavens He reigneth,
        Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth.

        2. Hasten as a bride to meet Him
        And with loving reverence greet Him;
        For with words of life immortal
        Now He knocketh at thy portal.
        Haste to ope the gates before Him,
        Saying, while thou dost adore Him,
        Suffer, Lord, that I receive Thee,
        And I nevermore will leave Thee.

        3. He who craves a precious treasure
        Neither cost nor pain will measure;
        But the priceless gifts of heaven
        God to us hath freely given.
        Though the wealth of earth were proffered,
        Naught would buy the fits here offered:
        Christ's true body, for thee riven,
        And His blood, for thee once given.

        4. Ah, how hungers all my spirit
        For the love I do not merit!
        Oft have I, with sighs fast thronging,
        Thought upon this food with longing,
        In the battle well-nigh worsted,
        For this cup of life have thirsted,
        For the Friend who here invites us
        And to God Himself unites us.

        5. In my heart I find ascending
        Holy awe, with rapture blending,
        As this mystery I ponder,
        Filling all my soul with wonder,
        Bearing witness at this hour
        Of the greatness of Thy power;
        Far beyond all human telling
        Is the power within Him dwelling.

        6. Human reason, though it ponder,
        Cannot fathom this great wonder
        That Christ's body e'er remaineth
        Though it countless souls sustaineth,
        And that He His blood is giving
        With the wine we are receiving.
        These great mysteries unsounded
        Are by God alone expounded.

        7. Jesus, Sun of Life, my Splendor,
        Jesus, Thou my Friend most tender,
        Jesus, Joy of my desiring,
        Fount of life, my soul inspiring, --
        At Thy feet I cry, my Maker,
        Let me be a fit partaker
        Of this blessed food from heaven,
        For our good, Thy glory, given.

        8. Lord, by love and mercy driven
        Thou hast left Thy throne in heaven
        On the cross for us to languish
        And to die in bitter anguish,
        To forego all joy and gladness
        And to shed Thy blood in sadness.
        By this blood, redeemed and living,
        Lord, I praise Thee with thanksgiving.

        9. Jesus, Bread of Life, I pray Thee,
        Let me gladly here obey Thee.
        By Thy love I am invited,
        Be Thy love with love requited;
        From this Supper let me measure,
        Lord, how vast and deep love's treasure.
        Though the gifts Thou here dost give me
        As Thy guest in heaven receive me.

        1. Lord Jesus Christ, Thou hast prepared
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, Thou hast prepared
        A feast for our salvation,
        It is Thy body and Thy blood;
        And at Thy invitation
        As weary souls, with sin opprest,
        We come to Thee for needed rest,
        For comfort and for pardon.

        2. Although Thou didst to heaven ascend,
        Where angel hosts are dwelling,
        And in Thy presence they behold
        Thy glory all excelling,
        And though Thy people shall not see
        Thy glory and Thy majesty
        Till dawns the Judgment morning,

        3. Yet, Savior, Thou art not confined
        To any habitation,
        But Thou art present everywhere
        And with Thy congregation.
        Firm as a rock this truth shall stand,
        Unmoved by any daring hand
        Or subtle craft and cunning.

        4. We eat this bread and drink this cup,
        Thy precious Word believing
        That Thy true body and Thy blood
        Our lips are here receiving.
        This word remains forever true,
        And there is naught Thou canst not do;
        For Thou, Lord, art almighty.

        5. Though reason cannot understand,
        Yet faith this truth embraces;
        Thy body, Lord, is everywhere
        At once in many places.
        How this can be I leave to Thee,
        Thy word alone sufficeth me,
        I trust its truth unfailing.

        6. Lord, I believe what Thou hast said,
        Help me when doubts assail me;
        Remember that I am but dust
        And let my faith not fail me.
        Thy Supper in this vale of tears
        Refreshes me and stills my fears
        And is my priceless treasure.

        7. Grant that we worthily receive
        Thy Supper, Lord, our Savior,
        And, truly grieving o'er our sins,
        May prove by our behavior
        That we are thankful for Thy grace
        And day by day may run our race,
        In holiness increasing.

        8. For Thy consoling Supper, Lord,
        Be praised throughout all ages!
        Preserve it, for in every place
        The world against it rages.
        Grant that this Sacrament may be
        A blessed comfort unto me
        When living and when dying.

        1. Draw nigh and take the body of the Lord
        1. Draw nigh and take the body of the Lord
        And drink the holy blood for you outpoured.
        Offered was He for greatest and for least,
        Himself the Victim and Himself the Priest.

        2. He that His saints in this world rules and shields
        To all believers life eternal yields,
        With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,
        Gives living waters to the thirsting soul.

        3. Approach ye, then, with faithful hearts sincere
        And take the pledges of salvation here.
        O Judge of all, our only Savior Thou,
        In this Thy feast of love be with us now.

        1. Invited, Lord, by boundless grace,
        1. Invited, Lord, by boundless grace,
        I stand a guest before Thy face;
        As Host Thou spreadst no common food:
        Here is Thy body and Thy blood.

        2. How holy is this Sacrament
        Where pardon, peace, and life are spent!
        This bread and cup my lips have pressed;
        Thou blessedst, and my soul is blessed.

        3. Now lettest Thou Thy guest depart
        With full assurance in his heart.
        For such communion, Lord, with Thee
        A new life may my offering be.

        4. When Thou shalt in Thy glory come
        To gather all Thy people home,
        Then let me, as Thy heavenly guest,
        In anthems praise Thee with the blest.

        1. O Jesus, blessed Lord, to Thee
        1. O Jesus, blessed Lord, to Thee
        My heartfelt thanks forever be,
        Who hast so lovingly bestowed
        On me Thy body and Thy blood.

        2. Break forth, my soul, for joy and say
        What wealth is come to me this day!
        My Savior dwells within my heart:
        How blest am I! How good Thou art!

        1. Thy table I approach,
        1. Thy table I approach,
        Dear Savior, hear my prayer;
        Oh, let no unrepented sin
        Prove hurtful to me there!

        2. Lo, I confess my sins
        And mourn their wretched bands;
        A contrite heart is sure to find
        Forgiveness at Thy hands.

        3. Thy body and Thy blood,
        Once slain and shed for me,
        Are taken here with mouth and soul,
        In blest reality.

        4. Search not how this takes place,
        This wondrous mystery;
        God can accomplish vastly more
        Than seemeth plain to thee.

        5. Vouchsafe, O blessed Lord,
        That earth and hell combined
        May ne'er about this Sacrament
        Raise doubt within my mind.

        6. Oh, may I never fail
        To thank Thee day and night
        For Thy true body and true blood,
        O God, my Peace and Light!

        1. Jesus Christ, our blessed Savior,
        1. Jesus Christ, our blessed Savior,
        Turned away God's wrath forever;
        By His bitter grief and woe
        He saved us from the evil Foe.

        2. As His pledge of love undying
        He, this precious food supplying,
        Gives His body with the bread
        And with the wine the blood He shed.

        3. Whoso to this Board repaireth
        May take heed how He prepareth;
        For if he does not believe,
        Then death for life he shall recieve.

        4. Praise the Father, who from heaven
        Unto us such food hath given
        And, to mend what we have done,
        Gave into death His only Son.

        5. Thou shalt hold with faith unshaken
        That this food is to be taken
        By the sick who are distrest,
        By hearts that long for peace and rest.

        6. Christ says: "Come, all ye that labor,
        And receive My grace and favor;
        They who feel no want nor ill
        Need no physician's help nor skill.

        7. "Useless were for thee My Passion,
        If thy works thy weal could fashion.
        This feast is not spread for thee
        If thine own Savior thou wilt be."

        8. If thy heart this truth professes
        And thy mouth thy sin confesses,
        His dear guest thou here shalt be,
        And Christ Himself shall banquet thee.

        1. Lord Jesus Christ, Thou living Bread,
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, Thou living Bread,
        May I for mine possess Thee.
        I would with heavenly food be fed;
        Descend, refresh, and bless me. 
        Now make me meet for Thee, O Lord;
        Now, humbly by my heart implored,
        Grant me Thy grace and mercy.

        2. Thou me to pastures green dost guide,
        To quiet waters lead me;
        Thy table Thou dost well provide
        And from Thy hand dost feed me.
        Sin, weakness, and infirmity
        Am I; O Savior, give to me
        The cup of Thy salvation.

        3. O Bread of heaven, my soul's Delight,
        For full and free remission
        With prayer I come before Thy sight,
        In sorrow and contrition.
        With faith adorn my soul that I
        May to Thy table now draw nigh
        With Thine own preparation.

        4. I merit not Thy favor, Lord,
        Sin now upon me lieth;
        Beneath my burden, self-abhorred,
        To Thee my spirit crieth.
        In all my grief this comforts me,
        That Thou on sinners graciously,
        Lord Jesus, hast compassion.

        1. O Lord, we praise Thee, bless Thee, and adore Thee,
        1. O Lord, we praise Thee, bless Thee, and adore Thee,
        In thanksgiving bow before Thee.
        Thou with Thy body and Thy blood didst nourish
        Our weak souls that they may flouish:
        O Lord, have mercy!
        May Thy body, Lord, born of Mary,
        That our sins and sorrows did carry,
         And Thy blood for us plead
        In all trial, fear, and need:
        O Lord, have mercy!

        2. Thy holy body into death was given,
        Life to win for us in heaven.
        No greater love than this to Thee could bind us;
        May this feast thereof remind us!
        O Lord, have mercy!
        Lord, Thy kindness did so constrain Thee
        That Thy blood should bless and sustain me.
        All our debt Thou hast paid;
        Peace with God once more is made:
        O Lord, have mercy.

        3. May God bestow on us His grace and favor
        To please Him with our behavior
        And live as brethren here in love and union
        Nor repent this blest Communion!
        O Lord, have mercy!
        Let not Thy good Spirit forsake us;
        Grant that heavenly-minded He make us;
        Give Thy Church, Lord, to see
        Days of peace and unity:
        O Lord, have mercy!

        1. Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
        1. Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
        That we may feed on Thee today;
        Beneath these forms of bread and wine
        Enrich us with Thy grace divine.

        2. The chastened peace of sin forgiven,
        The filial joy of heirs of heaven,
        Grant as we share this wondrous food,
        Thy body broken and Thy blood.

        3. Our trembling hearts cleave to Thy Word;
        All Thou hast said Thou dost afford,
        All that Thou art we here receive,
        And all we are to Thee we give.

        4. One bread, one cup, one body, we,
        United by our life in Thee,
        Thy love proclaim till Thou shalt come
        To bring Thy scattered loved ones home.

        5. Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
        To keep us steadfast to that day
        That each may be Thy welcomed guest
        When Thou shalt spread Thy heavenly feast.

        1. I come, O Savior, to Thy Table,
        1. I come, O Savior, to Thy Table,
        For weak and weary is my soul;
        Thou, Bread of Life, alone art able
        To satisfy and make me whole:

        REFRAIN:
        Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
        Be for my soul the highest good!

        2. Oh, grant that I in manner worthy
        May now approach Thy heavenly Board
        And, as I lowly bow before Thee,
        Look only unto Thee, O Lord!

        3. Unworthy though I am, O Savior,
        Because I have a sinful heart,
        Yet Thou Thy lamb wilt banish never
        For Thou my faithful Shepherd art!

        4. Oh, let me loathe all sin forever
        As death and poison to my soul
        That I through wilful sinning never
        May see Thy Judgment take its toll!

        5. Thy heart is filled with fervent yearning
        That sinners may salvation see
        Who, Lord, to Thee in faith are turning;
        So I, a sinner, come to Thee.

        6. Weary am I and heavy laden,
        With sin my soul is sore opprest;
        Receive me graciously, and gladden
        My heart, for I am now Thy guest.

        7. Thou here wilt find a heart most lowly
        That humbly falls before Thy feet,
        That duly weeps o'er sin, yet solely
        Thy merit pleads, as it is meet.

        8. By faith I call Thy holy Table
        The testament of Thy deep love;
        For, lo, thereby I now am able
        To see how love Thy heart doth move.

        9. What higher gift can we inherit?
        It is faith's bond and solid base;
        It is the strength of heart and spirit,
        The covenant of hope and grace.

        10. This feast is manna, wealth abounding
        Unto the poor, to weak ones power,
        To angels joy, to hell confounding,
        And life for us in death's dark hour.

        11. Thy body, given for me, O Savior,
        11. Thy body, given for me, O Savior,
        Thy blood which Thou for me didst shed,
        These are my life and strength forever,
        By them my hungry soul is fed.

        12. With Thee, Lord, I am now united;
        I live in Thee and Thou in me.
        No sorrow fills my soul, delighted
        It finds its only joy in Thee.

        13. Who can condemn me now? For surely
        The Lord is nigh, who justifies.
        No hell I fear, and thus securely,
        With Jesus I to heaven rise.

        14. Though death may threaten with disaster,
        It cannot rob me of my cheer;
        For He who is of death the Master
        With aid and comfort e'er is near.

        15. My heart has now become Thy dwelling,
        O blessed Holy Trinity.
        With angels I, Thy praises telling,
        Shall live in joy eternally.

        1. O living Bread from heaven,
        1. O living Bread from heaven,
        How richly hast Thou fed Thy guest!
        The gifts Thou now hast given
        Have filled my heart with joy and rest.
        O wondrous food of blessing,
        O cup that heals our woes!
        My heart, this gift professing,
        In thankful songs o'erflows;
        For while the faith within me
        Was quickened by this food,
        My soul hath gazed upon Thee,
        My highest, only Good.

        2. My God, Thou here hast led me
        Within Thy temple's holiest place
        And there Thyself hast fed me
        With all the treasures of Thy grace,
        Oh, boundless is Thy kindness,
        And righteous is Thy power,
        While I in sinful blindness
        Am erring hour by hour;
        And yet Thou com'st not spurning
        A sinner, Lord, like me!
        Thy grace and love returning,
        What gift have I for Thee?

        3. A heart that hath repented
        And mourns for sin with bitter sighs,--
        Thou, Lord, art well contented
        With this my only sacrifice.
        I know that in my weakness
        Thou wilt despise me not,
        But grant me in Thy meekness
        The blessing I have sought;
        Yes, Thou wilt hear with favor
        The song that now I raise,
        For meet and right 'tis ever
        That I should sing Thy praise.

        4. Grant what I have partaken
        May through Thy grace so work in me
        That sin be all forsaken
        And I may cleave alone to Thee
        And all my soul be heedful
        How I Thy love may know;
        For this alone is needful
        Thy love should in me glow.
        Then let no beauty ever,
        No joy, allure my heart,
        But what is Thine, my Savior,
        What Thou dost here impart.

        5. Oh, well for me that, strengthened
        With heavenly food and comfort here,
        Howe'er my course be lengthened,
        I now may serve Thee free from fear!
        Away, then, earthly pleasure!
        All earthly gifts are vain;
        I seek a heavenly treasure,
        My home I long to gain,
        My God, where I shall praise Thee,
        Where none my peace destroy,
        And where my soul shall raise Thee
        Glad songs in endless joy.

        1. Alas, my God, my sins are great,
        1. Alas, my God, my sins are great,
        My conscience doth upbraid me;
        And now I find that in my strait
        No man hath power to aid me.

        2. And fled I hence in my despair
        In some lone spot to hide me,
        My griefs would still be with me there
        And peace still be denied me.

        3. Lord, Thee I seek, I merit naught;
        Yet pity and restore me.
        Just God, be not Thy wrath my lot;
        Thy Son hath suffered for me.

        4. If pain and woe must follow sin,
        Then be my path still rougher.
        Here spare me not; if heaven I win,
        On earth I gladly suffer.

        5. But curb my heart, forgive my guilt,
        Make Thou my patience firmer;
        For they must miss the good Thou wilt
        Who at Thy chastenings murmur.

        6. Then deal with me as seems Thee best--
        Thy grace will help me bear it
        If but at last I see Thy rest
        And with my Savior share it.
        1. Before Thee, God, who knowest all,
        1. Before Thee, God, who knowest all,
        With grief and shame I prostrate fall.
        I see my sins against Thee, Lord,
        The sins of thought, of deed, and word.
        They press me sore; I cry to Thee:
        O God, be merciful to me!

        2. O Lord, my God, to Thee I pray:
        Oh, cast me not in wrath away!
        Let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart,
        But let Him draw to Thee my heart
        That truly penitent I be:
        O God, be merciful to me!

        3. O Jesus, let Thy precious blood
        Be to my soul a cleansing flood.
        Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away,
        But grant that justified I may
        Go to my house at peace with Thee:
        O God, be merciful to me!

        1. In Thee alone, O Christ, my Lord,
        1. In Thee alone, O Christ, my Lord,
        My hope on earth remaineth;
        I know Thou wilt Thine aid afford,
        Naught else my soul sustaineth.
        No strenghth of man, no earthly stay
        Can help me in the evil day;
        Thou, only Thou, canst aid supply.
        To Thee I cry;
        On Thee I bid my heart rely.

        2. My sins, O Lord, against me rise,
        I mourn them with contrition;
        Grant, through my death and sacrifice,
        To me a full remission.
        Lord, show before the Father's throne
        That Thou didst for my sins atone;
        So shall I from my load be freed.
        Thy Word I plead;
        Keep me, O Lord, each hour of need.

        3. O Lord, in mercy stay my heart
        On faith's most sure foundation
        And to my inmost soul impart
        Thy perfect consolation.
        Fill all my life with love to Thee,
        Toward all men grant me charity;
        And at the last, when comes my end,
        Thy succor send.
        From satan's wiles my soul defend.

        1. Lord Jesus, think on me
        1. Lord Jesus, think on me
        And purge away my sin;
        From earth-born passions set me free
        And make me pure within.

        2. Lord Jesus, think on me
        With many a care opprest;
        Let me Thy loving servant be
        And taste Thy promised rest.

        3. Lord Jesus, think on me
        Amid the battle's strife;
        In all my pain and misery
        Be Thou my Health and Life.

        4. Lord Jesus, think on me
        Nor let me go astray;
        Through darkness and perplexity
        Point Thou the heavenly way.

        5. Lord Jesus, think on me
        When floods the tempest high;
        When on doth rush the enemy,
        O Savior, be Thou nigh!

        6. Lord Jesus, think on me
        That, when the flood is past,
        I may the eternal brightness see
        And share Thy joy at last.

        7. Lord Jesus, think on me
        That I may sing above
        To Father, Spirit, and to Thee
        The strains of praise and love.

        1. O faithful God, thanks be to Thee
        1. O faithful God, thanks be to Thee
        Who dost forgive iniquity.
        Thou grantest help in sin's distress,
        And soul and body dost Thou bless.

        2. Thy servant now declares to me:
        "Thy sins are all forgiven thee.
        Depart in peace, but sin no more
        And e'er My pardoning grace adore."

        3. O Lord, we bless Thy gracious heart,
        For Thou Thyself dost heal our smart
        Through Christ, our Savior's precious blood,
        Which for the sake of sinners flowed.

        4. Give us Thy Spirit, peace afford
        Now and forever, gracious Lord.
        Preserve to us till life is spent
        Thy holy Word and Sacrament.

        1. And wilt Thou pardon, Lord,
        1. And wilt Thou pardon, Lord,
        A sinner such as I,
        Although Thy book his crimes record
        Of such a crimson dye?

        2. So deep are they engraved,
        So terrible their fear.
        The righteous scarcely shall be saved,
        And where shall I appear?

        3. O Thou Physician blest,
        Make clean my guilty soul
        And me, by many a sin opprest,
        Restore and keep me whole.

        4. I know not how to praise
        Thy mercy and Thy love;
        But deign my soul from earth to raise
        And learn from Thee above.

        1. With broken heart and contrite sigh,
        1. With broken heart and contrite sigh,
        A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry.
        Thy pardoning grace is rich and free,--
        O God, be merciful to me!

        2. I smite upon my troubled breast,
        With deep and conscious guilt opprest:
        Christ and His cross my only plea,--
        O God, be merciful to me!

        3. Far off I stand with tearful eyes
        Nor dare uplift them to the skies;
        But Thou dost all my anguish see,--
        O God, be merciful to me!

        4. Nor alms nor deeds that I have done
        Can for a single sin atone.
        To Calvary alone I flee,--
        O God, be merciful to me!

        5. And when, redeemed from sin and hell,
        With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
        My raptured song shall ever be,
        O God, be merciful to me!

        1. Jesus sinners doth receive;
        1. Jesus sinners doth receive;
        Oh, may all this saying ponder
        Who in sin's delusions live
        And from God and heaven wander!
        Here is hope for all who grieve--
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        2. We deserve but grief and shame,
        Yet His words, rich grace revealing,
        Pardon, peace, and life proclaim.
        Here their ills have perfect healing
        Who with humble hearts believe--
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        3. Sheep that from the fold did stray
        No true shepherd e'er forsaketh:
        Weary souls that lost their way
        Christ, the Shepherd, gently taketh
        In His arms that they may live--
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        4. Come, ye sinners, one and all,
        Come, accept His invitation;
        Come, obey His gracious call,
        Come and take His free salvation!
        Firmly in these words believe:
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        5. I, a sinner, come to Thee
        With a penitent confession;
        Savior, mercy show to me
        Grant for all my sins remission.
        Let these words my soul relieve:
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        6. Oh, how blest it is to know;
        Were as scarlet my transgression,
        It shall be as white as snow
        By Thy blood and bitter Passion:
        For these words I now believe:
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        7. Now my conscience is at peace,
        From the Law I stand acquitted;
        Christ hath purchased my release
        And my every sin remitted.
        Naught remains my soul to grieve,--
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        8. Jesus sinners doth receive.
        Also I have been forgiven;
        And when I this earth must leave,
        I shall find an open heaven.
        Dying, still to Him I cleave--
        Jesus sinners doth receive.

        1. O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry
        1. O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry
        Though all my crimes before Thee lie,
        Behold them not with angry look,
        But blot their memory from Thy book.

        2. Create my nature pure within
        And form my soul averse to sin;
        Let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart
        Nor hide Thy presence from my heart.

        3. I cannot live without Thy light,
        Cast out and banish from Thy sight;
        Thy holy joys, my God, restore
        And guard me that I fall no more.

        4. Though I have grieved Thy Spirit, Lord,
        His help and comfort still afford
        And let me now come near Thy throne
        To plead the merits of Thy Son.

        5. A broken heart, my God, my King,
        Is all the sacrifice I bring.
        Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye
        And save the soul condemned to die.

        6. Oh, may Thy love inspire my tongue
        Salvation shall be all my song;
        And all my powers shall join to bless
        The Lord, my Strength and Righteousness.

        1. Lord, to Thee I make confession;
        1. Lord, to Thee I make confession;
        I have sinned and gone astray,
        I have multiplied transgression,
        Chosen for myself my way,
        Led by Thee to see my errors,
        Lord, I tremble at Thy terrors.

        2. Yet, though conscience voice appal me,
        Father, I will seek Thy face;
        Though Thy child I dare not call me,
        Yet receive me to Thy grace.
        Do not for my sins forsake me;
        Do not let Thy wrath o'ertake me.

        3. For Thy Son did suffer for me,
        Gave Himself to rescue me,
        Died to heal me and restore me,
        Reconciled me unto Thee.
        'Tis alone His cross can vanquish
        These dark fears and soothe this anguish.

        4. Then on Him I cast my burden,
        Sink it in the depths below.
        Let me know Thy gracious pardon,
        Wash me, make me white as snow.
        Let Thy Spirit leave me never;
        Make me only Thine forever.

        1. Out of the deep I call
        1. Out of the deep I call
        To Thee, O Lord, to Thee.
        Before Thy throne of grace I fall;
        Be merciful to me.

        2. Out of the deep I cry,
        The woeful deep of sin,
        Of evil done in days gone by,
        Of evil now within;

        3. Out of the deep of fear
        And dread of coming shame;
        All night till morning watch is near
        I plead the precious name.

        4. Lord, there is mercy now,
        As ever was, with Thee.
        Before Thy throne of grace I bow;
        Be merciful to me. 

        1. O Jesus, Lamb of God, Thou art
        1. O Jesus, Lamb of God, Thou art
        The Life and Comfort of my heart.
        A sinner poor I come to Thee
        And bring my many sins with me.

        2. O God, my sin indeed is great;
        I groan beneath the dreadful weight.
        Be merciful to me, I pray;
        Take guilt and punishment away.

        3. Saint John the Baptist points to Thee
        And bids me cast my sin on Thee;
        For Thou hast left Thy throne on high
        To suffer for the world and die.

        4. Help me to mend my ways, O Lord,
        And gladly to obey Thy Word.
        While here I live, abide with me;
        And when I die, take me to Thee.

        1. From depths of woe I cry to Thee,
        1. From depths of woe I cry to Thee,
        Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.
        Bend down Thy gracious ear to me,
        My prayer let come before Thee.
        If Thou rememberest each misdeed,
        If each should have its rightful meed,
        Who may abide Thy presence?

        2. Thy love and grace alone avail
        To blot out my transgression;
        The best and holiest deeds must fail
        To break sin's dread oppression.
        Before Thee none can boasting stand,
        But all must fear Thy strict demand
        And live alone by mercy.

        3. Therefore my hope is in the Lord
        And not in mine own merit;
        It rests upon His faithful Word
        To them of contrite spirit
        That He is merciful and just;
        This is my comfort and my trust.
        His help I wait with patience.

        4. And though it tarry till the night
        And till the morning waken,
        My heart shall never doubt His might
        Nor count itself forsaken.
        Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,
        Ye of the Spirit born indeed;
        Wait for your God's appearing.

        5. Though great our sins and sore our woes,
        His grace much more aboundeth;
        His helping love no limit knows,
        Our utmost need it soundeth.
        Our shepherd good and true is He,
        Who will at last His Israel free
        From all their sin and sorrow.

        1. I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
        1. I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
        Invited by Thy gracious Word
        To this Thy feast, to sup with Thee;
        Grant that a worthy guest I be.

        2. I come to Thee with sin and grief,
        For Thou alone canst give relief.
        Thy death for me, dear Lord, I plead:
        O Jesus, help me in my need!

        3. Shouldst Thou a strict account demand,
        Who could, O Lord, before Thee stand?
        Purge all my secret sins away:
        Be Thou, O Christ, the sinner's Stay!

        4. O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
        Thou didst for all our sins atone;
        Though I have sinned and gone astray,
        Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away.

        5. O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
        Thou didst for all our sins atone;
        Be merciful, I Thee implore,
        Be merciful forevermore.

        1. I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
        1. I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
        Invited by Thy gracious Word
        To this Thy feast, to sup with Thee;
        Grant that a worthy guest I be.

        2. I come to Thee with sin and grief,
        For Thou alone canst give relief.
        Thy death for me, dear Lord, I plead:
        O Jesus, help me in my need!

        3. Shouldst Thou a strict account demand,
        Who could, O Lord, before Thee stand?
        Purge all my secret sins away:
        Be Thou, O Christ, the sinner's Stay!

        4. O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
        Thou didst for all our sins atone;
        Though I have sinned and gone astray,
        Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away.

        5. O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
        Thou didst for all our sins atone;
        Be merciful, I Thee implore,
        Be merciful forevermore.

        1. Yea, as I live, Jehovah saith,
        1. Yea, as I live, Jehovah saith,
        I would not have the sinner's death,
        But that he turn from error's ways,
        Repent, and live through endless days.

        2. To us therefore Christ gave command:
        "Go forth and preach in every land;
        Bestow on all My pardoning grace
        Who will repent and mend their ways.

        3. "All those whose sins ye thus remit
        I truly pardon and acquit,
        And those whose sins ye do retain
        Condemned and guilty shall remain.

        4. "What ye shall bind, that bound shall be:
        What ye shall loose, that shall be free;
        Unto My  Church the keys are given
        To ope and close the gates of heaven."

        5. The words which absolution give
        Are His who died that we might live;
        The minister whom Christ has sent
        Is but His humble instrument.

        6. When ministers lay on their hands,
        Absolved by Christ the sinner stands;
        He who by grace the Word believes
        The purchase of His blood receives.

        7. All praise, eternal Son, to Thee
        For absolution full and free,
        In which Thou showest forth Thy grace;
        From false indulgence guard our race.

        8. Praise God the Father and the Son
        And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
        As 'twas, is now, and so shall be
        World without end, eternally!

	1. Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,
	1. Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,
	With shield of faith and Spirit's sword.
	Forth to the battle may they go
	And boldly fight against the Foe.

	2. With banner of the Cross unfurled,
	They overcome the evil world
	And so at last receive from Thee
	The palm and crown of victory.

	3. Come, ever-blessed Spirit, come
	And make Thy servants hearts Thy home,
	May each a living temple be
	Hallowed forever, Lord, to Thee.

	4. Enrich that temple's holy shrine
	With sevenfold gifts of grace divine;
	With wisdom, light, and knowledge bless,
	With counsel, strength, fear, godliness.

	5. O Trinity in Unity,
	One only God and Persons Three,
	In whom, through whom, by whom, we live,
	To Thee we praise and glory give.

	6. Oh, grant us so to use Thy grace
	That we may see Thy glorious face
	And ever with the heavenly host
	Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!

	1. Blessed Savior, who hast taught me
	1. Blessed Savior, who hast taught me
	I should live to Thee alone,
	All these years Thy hand hath brought me
	Since I first was made Thine own.
	At the font my vows were spoken
	By my parents in the Lord;
	That my vows shall be unbroken
	At the altar I record.

	2. I would trust in Thy protecting,
	Wholly rest upon Thine arm,
	Follow wholly Thy directing,
	O my only Guard from harm,
	Meet me now with Thy salvation
	In Thy Church's ordered way;
	Let me feel Thy confirmation
	In Thy truth and fear today.

	3. So that, might and firmness gaining,
	Hope in danger, joy in grief,
	Now and evermore remaining
	In the one and true belief,
	Resting in my Savior's merit,
	Strengthened with Thy Spirit's strength,
	With Thy saints I may inherit
	All My Father's joy at length.

        1. Let me be Thine forever,
        1. Let me be Thine forever,
        Thou faithful God and Lord;
        Let me forsake Thee never
        Nor wander from Thy Word.
        Lord, do not let me waver,
        But give me steadfastness,
        And for such grace forever
        Thy holy name I'll bless.

        2. Lord Jesus, my Salvation,
        My Light, my Life divine,
        My only Consolation,
        Oh, make me wholly Thine!
        For Thou hast dearly bought me
        With blood and bitter pain.
        Let me, since Thou hast sought me,
        Eternal life obtain.

        3. And Thou, O Holy Spirit,
        My Comforter and Guide,
        Grant that in Jesus merit
        I always may confide,
        Him to the end confessing
        Whom I have known by faith.
        Give me Thy constant blessing
        And grant a Christian death.

	1. My Maker, be Thou nigh
	1. My Maker, be Thou nigh
	The light of life to give
	And guide me with Thine eye
	While here on earth I live.
	To Thee my heart I tender
	And all my powers surrender;
	Make it my one endeavor
	To love and serve Thee ever.
	Upon Thy promise I rely;
	My Maker, be Thou nigh.

	2. My Savior, wash me clean
	With Thy most precious blood,
	That takes away all sin
	And seals my peace with God
	My soul in peace abideth
	When in Thy wounds it hideth.
	There I find full salvation
	And freedom from damnation.
	Without Thee lost, defiled by sin,
	May Savior, wash me clean.

	3. My Comforter, give power
	That I may stand secure
	When in temptation's hour
	The world and sin allure.
	The Son to me revealing,
	Inspire my thought and feeling,
	His Word of grace to ponder,
	Nor let me from Him wander,
	On me Thy gifts and graces shower:
	My Comforter, give power!

	4. O Holy Trinity!
	To whom I all things owe,
	Thine image graciously
	Within my heart bestow.
	Choose me, though weak and lowly,
	To be Thy temple holy
	Where praise shall rise unending
	For grace so condescending.
	O heavenly bliss, Thine own to be,
	O Holy Trinity!

	1. My God, accept my heart this day
	1. My God, accept my heart this day
	And make it always Thine
	That I from Thee no more may stray,
	No more from Thee decline.

	2. Before the cross of Him who died,
	Behold, I prostrate fall;
	Let every sin be crucified
	And Christ be All in all.

	3. Anoint me with Thy Spirit's grace
	And seal me for Thine own
	That I may see Thy glorious face
	And worship near Thy throne.

	4. May the dear blood once shed for me
	My blest atonement prove
	That I from first to last may be
	The purchase of Thy love!

	5. Let every thought and work and word
	To Thee be ever given;
	Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
	And death the gate of heaven. 	

        1. Our Lord and God, oh, bless this day
        1. Our Lord and God, oh, bless this day
        And hear us, we implore Thee;
        None of Thy children turn away
        Who now appear before Thee.
        We come before Thy face
        And pray: Let Thy rich grace
        Descend from heaven above
        In all Thy wondrous love
        And keep us by Thy Spirit.

        2. Oh, bless Thy Word to all the young;
        Let them, Thy truth possessing,
        Bear witness true with heart and tongue,
        Their faith and ours confessing.
        From mother's arms Thy grace
        With love did them embrace;
        Baptized into Thy name,
        As Thine Thou didst them claim.
        O Lord, as Thine now own them!

        3. When they their vows today renew,
        Accept them with Thy favor;
        And when they promise to be true,
        May they forget it never!
        But they are weak and frail
        When Satan's hosts assail;
        Oh, arm them with Thy might
        And grant that in the fight
        They unto death be faithful!

        4. And when they leave their childhood home,
        When Satan comes alluring,
        May their baptismal grace become
        A refuge reassuring!
        Blest he who then can say:
        "God's covenant stands for aye."
        He ne'er shall be undone
        Who trusts in God alone--
        God is his mighty Father!

	1. Thine forever, God of Love!
	1. Thine forever, God of Love!
	Hear us from Thy throne above;
	Thine forever may we be
	Here and in eternity!

	2. Thine forever! Oh, how blest
	They who find in Thee their rest!
	Savior, Guardian, heavenly Friend,
	Oh, defend us to the end!

	3. Thine forever, Lord of Life!
	Shield us through our earthly strife.
	Thou, the Life, the Truth, the Way,
	Guide us to the realms of day.

	4. Thine forever! Shepherd, keep
	These Thy frail and trembling sheep
	Safe alone beneath Thy care,
	Let us all Thy goodness share.

	5. Thine forever! Thou our Guide,
	All our wants by Thee supplied,
	All our sins by Thee forgiven;
	Lead us, Lord, from earth to heaven.

	1. All hail the power of Jesus name!
	1. All hail the power of Jesus name!
	Let angels prostrate fall;
	Bring forth the royal diadem
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	2. Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
	Who from His altar call;
	Extol the Stem of Jesse's rod
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	3. Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
	Ye ransomed from the Fall,
	Hail Him who saves you by His grace
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	4. Hail Him, ye heirs of David's line,
	Whom David Lord did call,
	The God incarnate, Man divine,
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	5. Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget 
	The wormwood and the gall,
	Go, spread your trophies at His feet
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	6. Let every kindred, every tribe,
	On this terrestrial ball
	To Him all majesty ascribe
	And crown Him Lord of all.
	
	7. Oh, that with yonder sacred throng
	We at His feet may fall!
	We'll join the everlasting song
	And crown Him Lord of all.

	1. Awake, my soul, to joyful lays
	1. Awake, my soul, to joyful lays
	And sing Thy great Redeemer's praise.
	He justly claims a song from me,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, how free!
	
	2. He saw me ruined in the Fall,
	Yet loved me notwithstanding all.
	He saved me from my lost estate,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, how great!
	
	3. When I was Satan's easy prey
	And deep in debt and bondage lay,
	He paid His life for my discharge,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, how large.
	
	4. Through mighty hosts of cruel foes,
	Where earth and hell my way oppose,
	He safely leads my soul along,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, how strong!
	
	5. When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
	Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
	He near my soul has always stood,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, how near!
	
	6. When earthly friends forsake me quite
	And I have neither skill now might,
	He's sure my Helper to appear,--
	His loving-kindness, oh, near!
	
	7. Too oft I feel my sinful heart
	Prone from my Jesus to depart;
	But through I have Him oft forgot,
	His loving-kindness changes not.
	
	8. When I shall pass death's gloomy vale
	And all my mortal power must fail,
	Oh, may my last, expiring breath
	His loving-kindness sing in death!
	
	9. Then shall I mount and soar away
	To the bright world of endless day
	And sing with rapture and surprise
	His loving-kindness in the skies.

	1. Crown Him with many crowns
	1. Crown Him with many crowns
	The Lamb upon His throne;
	Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
	All music but its own.
	Awake, my soul, and sing
	Of Him who died for thee
	And hail Him as thy matchless King
	Through all eternity.
	
	2. Crown Him the Virgin's Son,
	The God incarnate born,
	Whose arm those crimson trophies won
	Which now His brow adorn;
	Fruit of the mystic rose,
	As of that rose the stem;
	The root whence mercy ever flows,
	The Babe of Bethlehem.
	
	3. Crown Him the Lord of Love.
	Behold His hands and side,
	Rich wounds, yet visible above,
	In beauty glorified.
	No angel in the sky 
	Can fully bear that sight,
	But downward bends his wondering eye
	At mysteries so bright!
	
	4. Crown Him the Lord of Life
	Who triumphed o'er the grave
	And rose victorious in the strife
	For those He came to save.
	His glories now we sing
	Who died and rose on high,
	Who died eternal life to bring
	And lives that death may die.
	
	5. Crown Him the Lord of Heaven,
	Enthroned in worlds above,
	Crown Him the King to whom is given 
	The wondrous name of Love.
	Crown Him with many crowns
	As thrones before Him fall;
	Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns 
	For He is King of all.

	1. How lovely shines the Morning Star!
	1. How lovely shines the Morning Star!
	The nations see and hail afar
	The light in Judah shining.
	Thou David's Son of Jacob's race,
	My Bridegroom and my King of Grace,
	For Thee my heart is pining.
	Lowly, Holy,
	Great and glorious, Thou victorious
	Prince of graces,
	Filling all the heavenly places.
	
	2. O highest joy by mortals won,
	True Son of God and Mary's Son,
	Thou high-born King of ages!
	Thou art my heart's most beauteous Flower,
	And Thy blest Gospel's saving power
	My raptured soul engages.
	Thou mine, I Thine;
	Sing hosanna! Heavenly manna
	Tasting, eating,
	Whilst Thy love in songs repeating.
	
	3. Now richly to my waiting heart,
	O Thou, my God, deign to impart
	The grace of love undying.
	In Thy blest body let me be,
	E'en as the branch is in the tree,
	Thy life my life supplying.
	Sighing, Crying.
	For the savor Of Thy favor;
	Resting never,
	Till I rest in Thee forever.
	
	4. A pledge of peace from God I see
	When Thy pure eyes are turned to me
	To show me Thy good pleasure.
	Jesus, Thy Spirit and Thy Word,
	Thy body and Thy blood, afford
	My soul its dearest treasure.
	Keep me Kindly
	In Thy favor, O my Savior!
	Thou wilt cheer me;
	Thy Word calls me to draw near Thee.
	
	5. Thou, mighty Father, in Thy Son
	Didst love me ere Thou hadst begun
	This ancient world's foundation.
	Thy Son hath made a friend of me,
	And when in spirit Him I see,
	I joy in tribulation.
	What bliss Is this!
	He that liveth To me giveth
	Life forever;
	Nothing me from Him can sever.
	
	6. Lift up the voice and strike the string.
	Let all glad sounds of music ring
	In God's high praises blended.
	Christ will be with me all the way,
	Today, tomorrow, every day,
	Till traveling days be ended.
	Sing out, Ring out
	Triumph glorious, O victorious,
	Chosen nation;
	Praise the God of your salvation.
	
	7. Oh, joy to know that Thou, my Friend,
	Art Lord, Beginning without end,
	The First and Last, Eternal!
	And Thou at length--O glorious grace!--
	Wilt take me to that holy place,
	The home of joys supernal.
	Amen, Amen!

	1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
	1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
	With angels round the throne.
	Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
	But all their joys are one.
	
	2. "Worthy the Lamb that died," they cry,
	"To be exalted thus."
	"Worthy the Lamb," our lips reply,
	For He was slain for us.
	
	3. Jesus is worthy to receive
	Honor and power divine;
	And blessings more than we can give
	Be, Lord, forever Thine.
	
	4. Let all creation join in one
	To bless the sacred name
	Of Him that sits upon the throne
	And to adore the Lamb.

	1. Jesus, Lover of my soul,
	1. Jesus, Lover of my soul,
	Let me to Thy bosom fly
	While the nearer waters roll,
	While the tempest still is high.
	Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
	Till the storm of life is past;
	Safe into the haven guide.
	Oh, receive my soul at last!
	
	2. Other refuge have I none;
	Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.
	Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
	Still support and comfort me!
	All my trust on Thee is stayed,
	All my help from Thee I bring;
	Cover my defenseless head
	With the shadow of Thy wing.
	
	3. Wilt Thou not regard my call,
	Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
	Lo, I sink, I faint, I fall;
	Lo, on Thee I cast my care;
	Reach me out Thy gracious hand!
	While I of Thy strength receive,
	Hoping against hope, I stand, 
	Dying , and behold, I live!
	
	4. Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
	More than all in Thee I find.
	Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
	Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
	Just and holy is Thy name;
	I am all unrighteousness,
	False and full of sin I am;
	Thou art full of truth and grace.
	
	5. Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
	Grace to cover all my sin.
	Let the healing streams abound;
	Make and keep me pure within.
	Thou of life the Fountain art,
	Freely let me take of Thee;
	Spring Thou up within my heart,
	Rise to all eternity.
	
	1. Jesus! and shall it ever be
	1. Jesus! and shall it ever be
	A mortal man ashamed of Thee?
	Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise,
	Whose glories shine through endless days?

	2. Ashamed of Jesus? Sooner far
	Let evening blush to own a star.
	He sheds the beams of light divine
	O'er this benighted soul of mine.

	3. Ashamed of Jesus? Just as soon
	Let midnight be ashamed of noon.
	'Tis midnight with my soul till He,
	Bright Morning Star, bids darkness flee.

	4. Ashamed of Jesus, that dear Friend
	On whom my hopes of heaven depend?
	No; when I blush, be this my shame,
	That I no more revere His name.

	5. Ashamed of Jesus? Yes, I may
	When I'v no guilt to wash away,
	No tear to wipe, no joy to crave,
    	No fears to quell, no soul to save.

	6. Till then--nor is the boasting vain--
	Till then I boast a Savior slain.
	And oh, may this my portion be,
	That Christ is not ashamed of me!

        1. Jesus, priceless Treasure,
        1. Jesus, priceless Treasure,
        Fount of purest pleasure,
        Truest Friend to me.
        Ah, how long in anguish
        Shall my spirit languish,
        Yearning, Lord, for Thee?
        Thou art mine, O Lamb divine!
        I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
        Naught I ask beside Thee.

        2. In Thine arms I rest me;
        Foes who would molest me
        Cannot reach me here.
        Though the earth be shaking,
        Every heart be quaking,
        Jesus calms my fear.
        Lightnings flash And thunders crash;
        Yet, though sin and hell assail me,
        Jesus will not fail me.

        3. Satan, I defy thee;
        Death, I now decry thee;
        Fear, I bid thee cease.
        World, thou shalt not harm me
        Nor thy threats alarm me
        While I sing of peace.
        God's great power Guards every hour;
        Earth and all its depths adore Him,
        Silent bow before Him.

        4. Hence, all earthly treasure!
        Jesus is my Pleasure,
        Jesus is my Choice.
        Hence, all empty glory!
        Naught to me thy story
        Told with tempting voice.
        Pain or loss, Or shame or cross,
        Shall not from my Savior move me
        Since He deigns to love me.

        5. Evil world, I leave thee;
        Thou canst not deceive me,
        Thine appeal is vain.
        Sin that once did blind me,
        Get thee far behind me,
        Come not forth again.
        Past thy hour, O pride and power;
        Sinful life, thy bonds I sever,
        Leave thee now forever.

        6. Hence, all fear and sadness!
        For the Lord of gladness,
        Jesus, enters in.
        Those who love the Father,
        Though the storms may gather,
        Still have peace within.
        Yea, whate'er I here must bear,
        Thou art still my purest Pleasure,
        Jesus, priceless Treasure!

        1. Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus,
        1. Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus,
        Can my heartfelt longing still.
        Lo, I pledge myself to Jesus
        What He wills alone to will.
        For my heart, which He hath filled,
        Ever cries, Lord, as Thou wilt.

        2. One there is for whom I'm living,
        Whom I love most tenderly;
        Unto Jesus I am giving
        What in love He gave to me.
        Jesus blood hides all my guilt;
        Lord, oh, lead me as Thou wilt.

        3. What to me may seem a treasure,
        But displeasing is to Thee,
        Oh, remove such harmful pleasure;
        Give instead what profits me.
        Let my heart by Thee be stilled.
        Make me Thine, Lord, as Thou wilt.

        4. Let me earnestly endeavor
        Thy good pleasure to fulfil;
        In me, through me, with me ever,
        Lord, accomplish Thou Thy will.
        In Thy holy image built,
        Let me die, Lord, as Thou wilt.

        5. Jesus, constant be my praises,
        For Thou unto me didst bring
        Thine own self and all Thy graces
        That I joyfully may sing:
        Be it unto me, my Shield,
        As Thou wilt, Lord, as Thou wilt.

        1.  Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
        1.  Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
        No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
        Unite my thankful heart to Thee
        And reign without a rival there.
        To Thee alone, dear Lord, I live;
        Myself to Thee, dear Lord, I give.

        2. Oh, grant that nothing in my soul
        May dwell but Thy pure love alone!
        Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,
        My Joy, my Treasure, and my Crown!
        All coldness from my heart remove;
        My every act, word, thought, be love.

        3. O Love, how cheering is Thy ray!
        All pain before Thy presence flies;
        Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away
        Where'er Thy healing beams arise.
        O Jesus, nothing may I see,
        Nothing desire or seek, but Thee!

        4. This love unwearied I pursue
        And dauntlessly to Thee aspire.
        Oh, may Thy love my hope renew,
        Burn in my soul like heavenly fire!
        And day and night be all my care
        To guard this sacred treasure there.

        5. Oh, draw me, Savior, e'er to Thee;
        So shall I run and never tire.
        With gracious words still comfort me;
        Be Thou my Hope, my sole Desire.
        Free me from every guilt and fear;
        No sin can harm if Thou art near.

        6. Still let Thy love point out my way;
        What wondrous things Thy love hath wrought!
        Still lead me lest I go astray;
        Direct my work, inspire my thought;
        And if I fall, soon may I hear
        Thy voice and know that love is near!

        7. In suffering be Thy love my peace,
        In weakness be Thy love my power;
        And when the storms of life shall cease,
        O Jesus, in that final hour,
        Be Thou my Rod and Staff and Guide
        And draw me safely to Thy side!

	1. Jesus, the very thought of thee
	1. Jesus, the very thought of thee
	With sweetness fills the breast;
	But sweeter far Thy face to see
	And in Thy presence rest.
	
	2. Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
	Nor can the memory find
	A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,
	O Savior or mankind!
	
	3. O Hope of every contrite heart,
	O Joy of all the meek!
	To those who fall, how kind Thou art,
	How good to those who seek!
	
	4. But what to those who find? Ah! this
	Nor tongue nor pen can show;
	The love of Jesus, what it is,
	None but His loved ones know.
	
	5. Jesus, our only Joy be Thou
	As Thou our Prize wilt be!
	Jesus, be Thou our Glory now
	And through eternity.

	1. Love Divine, all love excelling,
	1. Love Divine, all love excelling,
	Joy of heaven, to earth come down,
	Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
	All Thy faithful mercies crown.
	Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
	Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
	Visit us with Thy salvation,
	Enter every trembling heart.
	
	2. Breathe, oh, breathe Thy loving Spirit
	Into every troubled breast;
	Let us all in Thee inherit,
	Let us find the promised rest.
	Take away the love of sinning;
	Alpha and Omega be;
	End of faith as its beginning,
	Set our hearts at liberty.
	
	3. Come, Almighty, to deliver;
	Let us all Thy life receive.
	Suddenly return and never,
	Nevermore, Thy temples leave.
	Thee we would be always blessings,
	Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,
	Pray and praise Thee without ceasing,
	Glory in Thy perfect love.
	
	4. Finish, then, Thy new creation;
	Pure and spotless let us be.
	Let us see Thy great salvation
	Perfectly restored in Thee,
	Changed from glory into glory,
	Till in heaven we take our place,
	Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
	Lost in wonder, love, and praise.

	1. O Savior, precious Savior,
	1. O Savior, precious Savior,
	Whom, yet unseen, we love;
	O Name of might and favor,
	All other names above.
	We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
	To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
	We praise Thee and confess Thee,
	Our holy Lord and King.
	
	2. O Bringer of salvation,
	Who wondrously has wrought
	Thyself the revelation
	Of love beyond our thought,
	We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
	To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
	We praise Thee and confess Thee,
	Our holy Lord and King.
	
	3. In Thee all fulness dwelleth,
	All grace and power divine;
	The glory that excelleth,
	O Son of God, is Thine.
	We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
	To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
	We praise Thee and confess Thee,
	Our holy Lord and King.
	
	4. Oh, grant the consummation
	Of this our song above
	In endless adoration
	And everlasting love!
	We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
	To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
	We praise Thee and confess Thee,
	Our holy Lord and King.

	1. Lord Jesus Christ, 
	1. Lord Jesus Christ, 
	My Savior blest,
	My Hope and my Salvation!
	I trust in Thee;
	Deliver me
	From misery;
	Thy Word's my consolation.
	
	2. As Thou dost will,
	Lead Thou me still
	That I may truly serve Thee,
	My God, I pray,
	Teach me Thy way,
	To my last day
	In Thy true faith preserve me.
	
	3. Most heartily
	I trust in Thee;
	Thy mercy fails me never.
	Dear Lord, abide;
	My Helper tried,
	Thou Crucified,
	From evil keep me ever.
	
	4. Now henceforth must
	I put my trust
	In Thee, O dearest Savior.
	Thy comfort choice,
	Thy word and voice,
	My heart rejoice
	Despite my ill behavior.
	
	5. When sorrows rise,
	My refuge lies
	In Thy compassion tender.
	Within Thine arm
	Can naught alarm;
	Keep me from harm,
	Be Thou my strong Defender.
	
	6. I have Thy Word,
	Christ Jesus, Lord;
	Thou never wilt forsake me.
	This will I plead
	In time of need.
	Oh, help me speed
	When troubles overtake me!
	
	7. Grant, Lord, I pray,
	Thy grace each day
	That I, Thy Law revering,
	May live with Thee
	And happy be
	Eternally, 
	Before Thy throne appearing.

	1. In the Cross of Christ I glory,
	1. In the Cross of Christ I glory,
	Towering o'er the wrecks of time.
	All the light of sacred story
	Gathers round its head sublime.
	
	2. When the woes of life o'ertake me,
	Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
	Never shall the Cross forsake me;
	Lo, it glows with peace and joy.
	
	3. When the sun of bliss is beaming
	Light and love upon my way,
	From the Cross the radiance streaming
	Adds more luster to the day.
	
	4. Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
	By the Cross are sanctified;
	Peace is there that knows no measure,
	Joys that through all time abide.

	1. Thou art the _Way_; to Thee alone
	1. Thou art the _Way_; to Thee alone
	From sin and death we flee;
	And he who would the Gather seek
	Must seek Him, Lord, by Thee.
	
	2. Thou art the _Truth_; Thy Word alone
	True wisdom can impart;
	Thou only canst inform the mind
	And purify the heart.
	
	3. Thou art the _Life_; the rending tomb
	Proclaims Thy conquering arm;
	And those who put their trust in Thee
	Nor death nor hell shall harm.
	
	4. Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life;
	Grant us that Way to know,
	That Truth to keep, that life Life to win, 
	Whose joys eternal flow.
                                            
        1. Jesus, Savior, come to me;
        1. Jesus, Savior, come to me;
        Let me ever be with Thee,
        Come and nevermore depart,
        Thou who reignest in my heart.

        2. Lord, for Thee I ever sigh,
        Nothing else can satisfy.
        Ever do I cry to Thee:
        Jesus, Jesus, come to Me!

        3. Earthly joys can give no peace,
        Cannot bid my longing cease;
        Still to have my Jesus near,
        This is all my pleasure here.

        4. All that makes the angels glad,
        In their garb of glory clad,
        Only fills me with distress
        If Thy presence does not bless.

        5. Thou alone, my God and Lord,
        Art my Glory and Reward.
        Thou hast bled for me and died;
        In Thy wounds I safely hide.

        6. Come, then, Lamb for sinners slain,
        Come and ease me of my pain.
        Evermore I cry to Thee:
        Jesus, Jesus, come to me!

        7. Patiently I wait Thy Day;
        For this gift, O Lord, I pray,
        That, when death shall come to me,
        My dear Jesus Thou wilt be.

        1. Jesus, Thou art mine forever,
        1. Jesus, Thou art mine forever,
        Dearer far than earth to me;
        Neither life nor death shall sever
        Those sweet ties which bind to Thee.

        2. All were drear to me and lonely
        If Thy presence gladdened not;
        While I sing to Thee, Thee only,
        Mine's an ever blissful lot.

        3. Thou alone art all my Treasure,
        Who hast died that I may live;
        Thou conferrest noblest pleasure,
        Who dost all my sins forgive.

        4. Brightest gems and fairest flowers
        Lose their beauty in Thy frown;
        Joy and peace, like balmy showers,
        In Thy smile come gently down.

        5. Jesus, Thou art mine forever;
        Never suffer me to stray.
        Let me in my weakness never
        Cast my priceless pearl away.

        6. Lamb of God, I do implore Thee,
        Guard, support me, lest I fall.
        Let me evermore adore Thee;
        Be my everlasting All.

        1. Lamb of God, we fall before Thee,
        1. Lamb of God, we fall before Thee,
        Humbly trusting in Thy Cross.
        That alone be all our glory;
        All things else are only dross.

        2. Thee we own a perfect Savior,
        Only Source of all that's good.
        Every grace and every favor
        Comes to us through Jesus blood.

        3. Jesus gives us true repentance
        By His Spirit sent from heaven;
        Whispers this transporting sentence,
        "Son, thy sins are all forgiven."

        4. Faith He grants us to believe it,
        Grateful hearts His love to prize;
        Want we wisdom? He must give it,
        Hearing ears and seeing eyes.

        5. Jesus gives us pure affections,
        Wills to do what He requires,
        Makes us follow His directions,
        And what He commands, inspires.

        6. All our prayers and all our praises,
        Rightly offered in His name,--
        He that dictates them is Jesus;
        He that answers is the same.

        1. Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
        1. Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
        Thou, the true, the only Light,
        Sun of Righteousness, arise,
        Triumph o'er the shades of night.
        Dayspring from on high, be near;
        Day-star, in my heart appear.

        2. Dark and cheerless is the morn
        Unaccompanied by Thee;
        Joyless is the day's return
        Till Thy mercy's beams I see,
        Till they inward light impart,
        Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

        3. Visit, then, this soul of mine,
        Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
        Fill me, Radiancy Divine,
        Scatter all my unbelief.
        More and more Thyself display,
        Shining to the perfect day.

        1. Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
        1. Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
        My great Redeemer's praise,
        The glories of my God and King,
        The triumphs of His grace!

        2. My gracious Master and my God,
        Assist me to proclaim,
        To spread through all the earth abroad,
        The honors of Thy name.

        3. Jesus!--the name that charms our fears,
        That bids our sorrows cease;
        'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
        'Tis life and health and peace.

        4. He breaks the power of canceled sin,
        He sets the prisoner free;
        His blood can make the foulest clean;
        His blood avails for me.

        5. Look unto Him, ye nations; own
        Your God, ye fallen race,
        Look and be saved through faith alone,
        Be justified by grace.

        6. See all your sins on Jesus laid;
        The Lamb of God was slain;
        His soul was once an offering made
        For every soul of man.

        7. Glory to God and praise and love
        Be ever, ever given
        By saints below and saints above,
        The Church in earth and heaven.

        1. O Jesus, King most wonderful,
        1. O Jesus, King most wonderful,
        Thou Conqueror renowned,
        Thou Sweetness most ineffable,
        In whom all joys are found!

        2. When once Thou visitest the heart,
        The  truth begins to shine,
        Then earthly vanities depart,
        Then kindles love divine.

        3. O Jesus, Light of all below,
        Thou Fount of life and fire,
        Surpassing all the joys we know,
        All that we can desire--

        4. May every heart confess Thy name
        And ever Thee adore
        And, seeking Thee, itself inflame
        To seek Thee more and more!

        5. Thee may our tongues forever bless,
        Thee may we love alone,
        And ever in our lives express
        The image of Thine own!

        1. My soul's best Friend, what joy and blessing
        1. My soul's best Friend, what joy and blessing
        My spirit ever finds in Thee!
        From gloomy depths of doubt distressing
        Into Thine arms for rest I flee.
        Then will the night of sorrow vanish
        When from my heart Thy love doth banish
        All anguish and all pain and fear.
        Yea, here on earth begins my heaven;
        Who would not joyful be when given
        A loving Savior always near!

        2. For though the evil world revile me
        And prove herself my bitter foe
        Or by her smile seek to beguile me,
        I trust her not; her wiles I know.
        In Thee alone my soul rejoices,
        Thy praise alone it gladly voices,
        For Thou art true when friendships flee.
        The world may hate but cannot fell me;
        Would mighty waves of trial quell me,
        I anchor in Thy loyalty.

        3. Through deserts of the cross Thou leadest;
        I follow, leaning on Thy hand.
        From out the cloud Thy child Thou feedest
        And givest water from the sand.
        I trust Thy ways, howe'er distressing;
        I know my path will end in blessing;
        Enough that Thou wilt be my Stay.
        For whom to honor Thou intendest
        Oft into sorrow's vale Thou sendest;
        The night must e'er precede the day.

        4. My soul's best Friend, how well contented
        Am I, reposing on Thy breast;
        By sin no more am I tormented
        Since Thou dost grant me peace and rest.
        Oh, may the grace that Thou hast given
        For me a foretaste be of heaven,
        All anguish and all pain and fear.
        When I shall bask in joys divine!
        Away, vain world, with fleeting pleasures;
        In Christ I have abiding treasures.
        Oh, comfort sweet, my Friend is mine!

        1. To our Redeemer's glorious name
        1. To our Redeemer's glorious name
        Awake the sacred song.
        Oh, may His love, immortal flame,
        Tune every heart and tongue.

        2. His love, what human thought can reach,
        What mortal tongue portray?
        Imagination's utmost stretch
        In wonder dies away.

        3. He left His radiant throne on high,
        Left realms of heavenly bliss,
        And came to earth to bleed and die,--
        Was ever love like this?

        4. Dear Lord, while we adoring pay
        Our humble thanks to Thee,
        May every heart with rapture say,
        "The Savior died for me!"

        5. Oh, my the sweet, the blissful theme
        Fill every heart and tongue
        Till strangers love the charming name
        And join the sacred song!

        1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
        1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
        In a believer's ear!
        It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
        And drives away his fear.

        2. It makes the wounded spirit whole
        And calms the troubled breast;
        'Tis manna to the hungry soul
        And to the weary, rest.

        3. Dear name! The Rock on which I build,
        My Shield and Hiding-place;
        My never-failing Treasury filled
        With boundless stores of grace.

        4. By Thee my prayers acceptance gain
        Although with sin defiled.
        Satan accuses me in vain,
        And I am owned a child.

        5. Jesus, my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
        My Prophet, Priest, and King,
        My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
        Accept the praise I bring.

        6. Weak is the effort of my heart
        And cold my warmest thought;
        But when I see Thee as Thou art,
        I'll praise Thee as I ought.

        7. Till then I would Thy love proclaim
        With every fleeting breath;
        And may the music of Thy name
        Refresh my soul in death.

        1. Jesus I will never leave,
        1. Jesus I will never leave,
        Who for me Himself hath given;
        Firmly unto Him I'll cleave
        Nor from Him be ever driven.
        Life from Him doth light receive,--
        Jesus I will never leave.

        2. Jesus I will never leave
        While on earth I am abiding;
        What I have to Him I give,
        In all cares in Him confiding.
        Naught shall me of Him bereave,--
        Jesus I will never leave.

        3. Though my sight shall pass away,
        Hearing, taste, and feeling fail me;
        Though my life's last light of day
        Shall o'ertake and sore assail me;
        When His summons I receive,
        Jesus I will never leave.

        4. Nor will I my Jesus leave
        When at last I shall come thither
        Where His saints He will receive,
        Where is bliss they live together.
        Endless joy to me He'll give,--
        Jesus I will never leave.

        5. Nor for earth's vain joys I crave
        Nor, without Him, heaven's pleasure;
        Jesus, who my soul did save,
        Evermore shall be my Treasure.
        He redemption did achieve,--
        Jesus I will never leave.

        1. One thing's needful; Lord this treasure
        1. One thing's needful; Lord this treasure
        Teach me highly to regard;
        All else, though it first give pleasure,
        Is a yoke that presses hard.
        Beneath it the heart is still fretting and striving,
        No true, lasting happiness ever deriving.
        The gain of this one thing all loss can requite
        And teach me in all things to find true delight.

        2. Wilt thou find this one thing needful,
        Turn from all created things
        Unto Jesus and be heedful
        Of the blessed joy He brings.
        For where God and Man both in one are united,
        With God's perfect fulness the heart is delighted;
        There, there is the worthiest lot and the best,
        My One and my All and my Joy and my Rest.

        3. How were Mary's thoughts devoted,
        Her eternal joy to find
        As intent each word she noted,
        At her Savior's feet reclined!
        How kindled her heart, how devout was its feeling,
        While hearing the lessons that Christ was revealing!
        For Jesus all earthly concerns she forgot,
        And all was repaid in that one happy lot.

        4. Thus my longings, heavenward tending,
        Jesus, rest alone on Thee.
        Help me, thus on Thee depending;
        Savior come and dwell in me.
        Although all the world should forsake and forget Thee,
        In love I will follow Thee, ne'er will I quit Thee.
        Lord Jesus, both spirit and life is Thy Word;
        And is there a joy which Thou dost not afford?

        5. Wisdom's highest, noblest treasure,
        Jesus, lies concealed in Thee;
        Grant that this may still the measure
        Of my will and actions be,
        Humility there and simplicity reigning,
        In paths of true wisdom my steps ever training.
        Oh, if I of Christ have this knowledge divine,
        The fulness of heavenly wisdom is mine.

        6. Naught have I, O Christ, to offer
        Naught but Thee, my highest Good.
        Naught have I, O Lord, to proffer
        But Thy crimson-colored blood.
        Thy death on the cross hath Death wholly defeated
        And thereby my righteousness fully completed;
        Salvation's white raiments I there did obtain,
        And in them in glory with Thee I shall reign.

        7. Therefore Thou alone, my Savior,
        Shalt be All in all to me;
        Search my heart and my behavior,
        Root out all hypocrisy.
        Restrain me from wandering on pathways unholy
        And through all life's pilgrimage keep my heart lowly.
        This one thing is needful, all others are vain;
        I count all but loss that I Christ may obtain.

        1. Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!
        1. Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!
        Hail, Thou Galilean King!
        Thou didst suffer to release us;
        Thou didst free salvation bring.
        Hail, Thou universal Savior,
        Who hast borne our sin and shame,
        By whose merits we find favor!
        Life is given through Thy name.

        2. Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
        All our sins on Thee were laid;
        By almighty love anointed,
        Thou hast full atonement made.
        Every sin may be forgiven
        Through the virtue of Thy blood;
        Open is the gate of heaven,
        Peace is made 'twist man and God.

        3. Jesus, hail, enthroned in glory,
        There forever to abide!
        All the heavenly host adore Thee,
        Seated at Thy Father's side.
        There for sinners Thou art pleading,
        There Thou dost our place prepare,
        Ever for us interceding
        Till in glory we appear.

        4. Worship, honor, power, and blessing
        Thou art worthy to receive;
        Loudest praises, without ceasing,
        Meet it is for us to give.
        Help, ye bright angelic spirits,
        Bring your sweetest, noblest lays;
        Help to sing our Savior's merits,
        Help to chant Immanuel's praise.

        1. The Lord my pasture shall prepare
        1. The Lord my pasture shall prepare
        And feed me with a shepherd's care;
        His presence shall my wants supply
        And guard me with a watchful eye;
        My noonday walks He shall attend
        And all my midnight hours defend.

        2. When in the sultry glebe I faint
        Or on the thirsty mountain pant,
        To fertile vales and dewy meads
        My weary, wandering steps He leads,
        Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
        Amid the verdant landscape flow.

        3. Though in the paths of death I tread,
        With gloomy horrors overspread,
        My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
        For Thou, O Lord, art with me still;
        Thy friendly crook shall give me aid
        And guide me through the dreadful shade.

        4. Though in a bare and rugged way,
        Through devious lonely wilds, I stray,
        Thy bounty shall my pains beguile;
        The barren wilderness shall smile,
        With sudden greens and herbage crowned,
        And streams shall murmur all around.

        1. All mankind fell in Adam's fall,
        1. All mankind fell in Adam's fall,
        One common sin infects them all;
        From sire to son the bane descends,
        And over all the curse impends.

        2. Through all man's powers corruption creeps
        And him in dreadful bondage keeps;
        In guilt he draws his infant breath
        And reaps its fruits of woe and death.

        3. From hearts depraved, to evil prone,
        Flow thoughts and deeds of sin alone;
        God's image lost, the darkened soul
        Nor seeks nor finds its heavenly goal.

        4. But Christ, the second Adam, came
        To bear our sin and woe and shame,
        To be our Life, our Light, our Way,
        Our only Hope, our only Stay.

        5. As by one man all mankind fell
        And, born in sin, was doomed to hell,
        So by one Man, who took our place,
        We all received the gift of grace.

        6. We thank Thee, Christ; new life is ours,
        New light, new hope, new strength, new powers:
        May grace our every way attend
        Until we reach our journey's end!

        1. My hope is built on nothing less
        1. My hope is built on nothing less
        Than Jesus blood and righteousness;
        I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
        But wholly lean on Jesus name.
        On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
        All other ground is sinking sand.

        2. When darkness veils His lovely face,
        I rest on His unchanging grace;
        In every high and stormy gale
        My anchor holds within the veil.
        On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
        All other ground is sinking sand.

        3. His oath, His covenant, and blood
        Support me in the whelming flood;
        When every earthly prop gives way,
        He then is all my Hope and Stay.
        On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
        All other ground is sinking sand.

        4. When He shall come with trumpet sound,
        Oh, may I then in Him be found,
        Clothed in His righteousness alone,
        Faultless to stand before the throne!
        On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
        All other ground is sinking sand.

        1. Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
        1. Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
        My beauty are, my glorious dress;
        Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
        With joy shall I lift up my head.

        2. Bold shall I stand in that great Day,
        For who aught to my charge shall lay?
        Fully through these absolved I am
        From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.

        3. The holy, meek, unspotted Lamb,
        Who from the Father's bosom came,
        Who died for me, e'en me t'atone,
        Now for my Lord and God I own.

        4. Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,
        Which at the mercy-seat of God
        Forever doth for sinners plead,
        For me--e'en for my soul--was shed.

        5. Lord, I believe were sinners more
        Than sands upon the ocean shore,
        Thou hast for all a ransom paid,
        For all a full atonement made.

        6. When from the dust of death I rise
        To claim my mansion in the skies,
        E'en then, this shall be all my plea:
        Jesus hath lived and died for me.

        7. Jesus, be endless praise to Thee,
        Whose boundless mercy hath for me,
        For me, and all Thy hands have made,
        An everlasting ransom paid.

        1. Through Jesus blood and merit
        1. Through Jesus blood and merit
        I am at peace with God;
        What, then, can daunt my spirit,
        However dark my road?
        My courage shall not fail me,
        For God is on my side;
        Though hell itself assail me,
        Its rage I may deride.

        2. There's naught that me can sever
        From the great love of God;
        No want, no pain, whatever,
        No famine, peril, flood.
        Though thousand foes surround me,
        For slaughter mark Thy sheep,
        They never shall confound me,
        The victory I shall reap.

        3. Yea, neither life's temptation
        Nor death's so trying hour,
        Nor angels of high station,
        Nor any other power,
        Nor things that now are present,
        Nor things that are to come,
        Nor height, however pleasant,
        Nor depths of deepest gloom.

        4. Nor any creature ever
        Shall from the love of God
        This wretched sinner sever;
        For in my Savior's blood
        This love its fountain taketh;
        He hears my faithful prayer
        And nevermore forsaketh
        His own dear child and heir.

        1. By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless;
        1. By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless;
        My soul, believe and doubt it not.
        Why stagger at this word of promise?
        Hath Scripture ever falsehood taught?
        Nay; then this word must true remain;
        By grace thou, too, shalt heav'n obtain.

        2. By grace! None dare lay claim to merit;
        Our works and conduct have no worth.
        God in His love sent our Redeemer,
        Christ Jesus, to this sinful earth;
        His death did for our sins atone,
        And we are saved by grace alone.

        3. By grace! Oh, mark this word of promise
        When thou art by thy sins opprest,
        When Satan plagues thy troubled conscience,
        And when thy heart is seeking rest.
        What reason cannot comprehend
        God by His grace to thee doth send.

        4. By grace God's Son, our only Savior,
        Came down to earth to bear our sin.
        Was it because of thine own merit
        That Jesus died thy soul to win?
        Nay, it was grace, and grace alone,
        That brought Him from His heavenly throne.

        5. By grace! This ground of faith is certain;
        So long as God is true, it stands.
        What saints have penned by inspiration,
        What in His Word our God commands,
        What our whole faith must rest upon,
        Is Grace alone, grace in His Son.

        6. By grace to timid hearts that tremble,
        In tribulation's furnace tried,--
        By grace, despite all fear and trouble,
        The Father's heart is open wide.
        Where could I help and strength secure
        If grace were not my anchor sure?

        1. Grace! 'Tis a charming sound,
        1. Grace! 'Tis a charming sound,
        Harmonious to the ear;
        Heaven with the echo shall resound,
        And all the earth shall hear.

        2. Grace first contrived the way
        To save rebellious man,
        And all the steps that grace display
        Which drew the wondrous plan.

        3. Grace first inscribed my name
        In God's eternal book;
        'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
        Who all my sorrows took.

        4. Grace led my wandering feet
        To tread the heavenly road;
        And new supplies each hour I meet
        While pressing on to God.

        5. Grace taught my soul to pray
        And made mine eyes o'erflow;
        'Twas grace that kept me to this day
        And will not let me go.

        6. Grace all the work shall crown
        Through everlasting days;
        It lays in heaven the topmost stone
        And well deserves the praise.

        1. If Thy beloved Son, O God,
        1. If Thy beloved Son, O God,
        Had not to earth descended
        And in our mortal flesh and blood
        Had not sin's power ended,
        Then this poor, wretched soul of mine
        In hell eternally would pine
        Because of its transgression.

        2. But now I find sweet peace and rest,
        Despair no more reigns o'er me;
        No more am I by sin opprest,
        For Christ has borne sin for me.
        Upon the cross for me He died
        That, reconciled, I might abide
        With Thee, my God, forever.

        3. I trust in Him with all my heart;
        Now all my sorrow ceases;
        His words abiding peace impart,
        His blood from guilt releases.
        Free grace through Him I now obtain;
        He washes me from every stain,
        And pure I stand before Him.

        4. All righteousness by works is vain,
        The Law brings condemnation;
        True righteousness by faith I gain,
        Christ's work is my salvation.
        His death, that perfect sacrifice,
        Has paid the all-sufficient price;
        In Him my hope is anchored.

        5. My guilt, O Father, Thou hast laid
        On Christ, Thy Son, my Savior.
        Lord Jesus, Thou my debt hast paid
        And gained for me God's favor.
        O Holy Ghost, Thou Fount of grace,
        The good in me to Thee I trace;
        In faith do Thou preserve me.

        1. Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
        1. Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
        Let me hide myself in Thee;
        Let the water and the blood
        From Thy riven side which flowed
        Be of sin the double cure,
        Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

        2. Not the labors of my hands
        Can fulfil Thy Law's demands;
        Could my zeal no respite know,
        Could my tears forever flow,
        All for sin could not atone;
        Thou must save, and Thou alone.

        3. Nothing in my hand I bring,
        Simply to Thy cross I cling;
        Naked, come to Thee for dress;
        Helplees, look to Thee for grace;
        Foul, I to the fountain fly,--
        Wash me, Savior, or I die!

        4. While I draw this fleeting breath,
        When mine eyelids close in death,
        When I soar to worlds unknown,
        See Thee on Thy judgment-throne,
        Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
        Let me hide myself in Thee!

        1. Salvation unto us has come
        1. Salvation unto us has come
        By God's free grace and favor;
        Good works cannot avert our doom,
        They help and save us never.
        Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone,
        Who did for all the world atone;
        He is our one Redeemer.

        2. What God did in His Law demand
        And none to Him could render
        Caused wrath and woe on every hand
        For man, the vile offender.
        Our flesh has not those pure desires
        The spirit of the Law requires,
        And lost is our condition.

        3. It was a false, misleading dream
        That God His Law had given
        That sinners should themselves redeem
        And by their works gain heaven.
        The Law is but a mirror bright
        To bring the inbred sin to light
        That lurks within our nature.

        4. From sin our flesh could not abstain,
        Sin held its sway unceasing;
        The task was useless and in vain,
        Our gilt was e'er increasing.
        None can remove sin's poisoned dart
        Or purify our guileful heart,-
        So deep is our corruption.

        5. Yet as the Law must be fulfilled
        Or we must die despairing,
        Christ came and hath God's anger stilled,
        Our human nature sharing.
        He hath for us the Law obeyed
        And thus the Father's vengeance stayed
        Which over us impended.

        6. Since Christ hath full atonement made
        And brought to us salvation,
        Each Christian therefore may be glad
        And build on this foundation.
        Thy grace alone, dear Lord, I plead,
        Thy death is now my life indeed,
        For Thou hast paid my ransom.

        7. Let me not doubt, but trust in Thee,
        Thy Word cannot be broken;
        Thy call rings out, "Come unto Me!"
        No falsehood hast Thou spoken.
        Baptized into Thy precious name,
        My faith cannot be put to shame,
        And I shall never perish.

        8. The Law reveals the guilt of sin
        And makes men conscience-stricken;
        The Gospel then doth enter in
        The sinful soul to quicken.
        Come to the cross, trust Christ, and live;
        The Law no peace can ever give,
        No comfort and no blessing.

        9. Faith clings to Jesus cross alone
        And rests in Him unceasing;
        And by its fruits true faith is known,
        With love and hope increasing.
        Yet faith alone doth justify,
        Works serve thy neighbor and supply
        The proof that faith is living.

        10. All blessing, honor, thanks, and praise
        To Father, Son, and Spirit,
        The God that saved us by His grace,-
        All glory to His merit!
        O Triune God in heaven above,
        Who hast revealed Thy saving love,
        Thy blessed name be hallowed.

        1. All that I was, my sin, my guilt,
        1. All that I was, my sin, my guilt,
        My death, was all my own;
        All that I am I owe to Thee,
        My gracious God, alone.

        2. The evil of my former state
        Was mine, and only mine;
        The good in which I now rejoice
        Is Thine, and only Thine.

        3. The darkness of my former state,
        The bondage, all was mine;
        The light of life in which I walk,
        The liberty, is Thine.

        4. Thy Word first made me feel my sin,
        It taught me to believe;
        Then, in believing, peace I found,
        And now I live, I live!

        5. All that I am, e'en here on earth,
        All that I hope to be,
        When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
        I owe it, Lord, to Thee.

        1. I do not come because my soul
        1. I do not come because my soul
        Is free from sin and pure and whole
        And worthy of Thy grace;
        I do not speak to Thee because
        I've never justly kept Thy laws
        And dare to meet Thy face.

        2. I know that sin and guilt combine
        To reign o'er every thought of mine
        And torn from good to ill;
        I know that, when I try to be
        Upright and just and true to Thee,
        I am a sinner still.

        3. I know that often when I strive
        To keep a spark of love alive
        For Thee, the powers within
        Leap up in unsubmissive might
        And oft benumb my sense of right
        And pull me back to sin.

        4. I know that, though in doing good
        I spend my life, I never could
        Atone for all I've done;
        But though my sins are black as night,
        I dare to come before Thy sight
        Because I trust Thy Son.

        5. In Him alone my trust I place,
        Come boldly to Thy Throne of grace,
        And there commune with Thee.
        Salvation sure, O Lord, is mine,
        And, all unworthy, I am Thine,
        For Jesus died for me.

        1. Thy works, not mine, O Christ,
        1. Thy works, not mine, O Christ,
        Speak gladness to this heart;
        They tell me all is done,
        They bid my fear depart.
        To whom save Thee, who canst alone
        For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

        2. Thy wounds, not mine, O Christ,
        Can heal my bruised soul;
        Thy stripes, not mine, contain
        The balm that makes me whole.
        To whom save Thee, who canst alone
        For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

        3. Thy cross, not mine, O Christ,
        Has borne the awe-full load
        Of sins that none could bear
        But the incarnate God.
        To whom save Thee, who canst alone
        For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

        4. Thy death, not mine, O Christ,
        Has paid the ransom due;
        Ten thousand deaths like mine
        Would have been all too few.
        To whom save Thee, who canst alone
        For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

        5. Thy righteousness, O Christ,
        Alone can cover me;
        No righteousness avails
        Save that which is of Thee.
        To whom save Thee, who canst alone
        For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

        1. I know my faith is founded
        1. I know my faith is founded
        On Jesus Christ, my God and Lord;
        And this my faith confessing
        Unmoved I stand upon His Word.
        Man's reason cannot fathom
        The truth of God profound;
        Who trusts her subtle wisdom
        Relies on shifting ground.
        God's Word is all-sufficient,
        It makes divinely sure,
        And trusting in its wisdom,
        My faith shall rest secure.

        2. Increase my faith, dear Savior,
        For Satan seeks by night and day
        To rob me of this treasure
        And take my hope of bliss away.
        But, Lord, with Thee beside me,
        I shall be undismayed;
        And led by Thy good Spirit,
        I shall be unafraid.
        Abide with me, O Savior,
        A firmer faith bestow;
        Then I shall bid defiance
        To every evil foe.

        3. In faith, Lord, let me serve Thee;
        Though persecution, grief and pain
        Should seek to overwhelm me,
        Let me a steadfast trust retain;
        And then at my departure
        Take Thou me home to Thee
        And let me there inherit
        All thou hast promised me.
        In life and death, Lord, keep me
        Until Thy heaven I gain,
        Where I by Thy great mercy
        The end of faith attain.

        1. Lord, we confess our numerous faults;
        1. Lord, we confess our numerous faults;
        How great our guilt has been,
        How vain and foolish all our thoughts,
        And all our lives were sin.

        2. But, O my soul, forever praise,
        Forever love, His name
        Who turns thy feet from dangerous ways
        Of folly, sin, and shame.

        3. 'Tis not by works of righteousness
        Which our own hands have done,
        But we are saved by God's free grace
        Abounding through His Son.

        4. 'Tis from the mercy of our God
        That all our hopes begin;
        'Tis by the Water and the Blood
        Our souls are washed from sin.

        5. 'Tis through the purchase of His death
        Who hung upon the tree
        The Spirit is sent down to breathe
        On such dry bones as we.

        6. Raised from the dead, we live anew;
        And justified by grace.
        We shall appear in glory, too,
        And see our Father's face.

        1. Seek where ye may To find a way
        1. Seek where ye may To find a way
        That leads to your salvation;
        My heart is stilled, On Christ I build,
        He is the one Foundation.
        His Word is sure, His works endure;
        He doth o'erthrow My every foe;
        Through Him I more than conquer.

        2. Seek whom ye may To be your stay;
        None can redeem his brother.
        All helpers failed, This Man prevailed,
        The God-man, and none other.
        Our Servant-Lord Did help afford;
        We're justified, For He hath died,
        The Guiltless for the guilty.

        3. Seek Him alone, Who did atone,
        Who did your souls deliver;
        Yea, seek Him first, All ye who thirst
        For grace that faileth never.
        In every need Seek Him indeed;
        To every heart He will impart
        His blessings without measure.

        4. My heart's Delight, My Crown most bright,
        Thou, Jesus, art forever.
        Nor wealth nor pride Nor aught beside
        Our bond of love shall sever.
        Thou art my Lord; Thy precious Word
        Shall be my guide, Whate'er betide.
        Oh, teach me, Lord, to trust Thee!

        5. Hide not from me, I ask of Thee,
        Thy gracious face and favor.
        Though floods of woe Should o'er me flow,
        My faith shall never waver.
        From pain and grief Grant sweet relief;
        For tears I weep, Lord, let me reap
        Thy heavenly joy and glory.

        1. Oh, how great is Thy compassion,
        1. Oh, how great is Thy compassion,
        Faithful Father, God of grace,
        That with all our fallen race
        And in our deep degradation
        Thou wast merciful that we
        Might be saved eternally!

        2. Thy great love for this hath striven
        That we may from sin be free
        And forever live with Thee;
        Yea, Thy Son Himself hath given
        And extends an earnest call
        To His Supper unto all.

        3. And for this our soul's salvation
        Voucheth Thy good Spirit, Lord,
        In Thy Sacraments and Word.
        He imparts true consolation,
        Granteth us the gift of faith
        That we fear nor hell nor death.

        4. Lord, Thy mercy will not leave me,-
        Truth doth evermore abide,-
        Then in Thee I will confide.
        Since Thy Word cannot decive me,
        My salvation is to me
        Well assured eternally.

        5. I will praise Thy great compassion,
        Faithful Father, God of grace,
        That with all our fallen race
        And in our deep degradation
        Thou wast merciful that we
        Might bring endless praise to Thee.

        1. Now I have found the firm foundation
        1. Now I have found the firm foundation
        Which holds mine anchor ever sure;
        'Twas laid before the world's creation
        In Christ my Savior's wounds secure;
        Foundation which unmoved shall stay
        When heaven and earth will pass away.

        2. It is that mercy never ending,
        Which human wisdom far transcends,
        Of Him who, loving arms extending,
        To wretched sinners condescends;
        Whose heart with pity still doth break
        Whether we seek Him or forsake.

        3. Our ruin God hath not intended,
        For our salvation He hath yearned;
        For this His Son to earth descended
        And then to heaven again returned;
        For this so patient evermore
        He knocketh at our heart's closed door.

        4. O depth of love, to me revealing
        The sea where my sins disappear!
        In Christ my wounds find perfect healing,
        There is no condemnation here;
        For Jesus blood through earth and skies
        Forever "Mercy! Mercy!" cries.

        5. I never will forget this crying;
        In faith I'll trust it all my days,
        And when o'er all my sins I'm sighing,
        Into the Father's heart I'll gaze;
        For there is always to be found
        Free mercy without end and bound.

        6. Though I be robbed of every pleasure
        That makes my soul and body glad
        And be deprived of earthly treasure
        And be forsaken, lone, and sad,
        Though my desire for help seem vain,
        His mercy shall with me remain.

        7. Though earthly trials should oppress me
        And cares from day to day increase;
        Though earth's vain things should sore distress me
        And rob me of my Savior's peace;
        Though I be brought down to the dust,
        Still in His mercy I will trust.

        8. When all my deeds I am reviewing,
        The deeds that I admire the most,
        I find in all my thought and doing
        That there is naught whereof to boast,
        Yet this sweet comfort shall abide--
        In mercy I can still confide.

        9. Let mercy cause me to be willing
        To bear my lot and not to fret.
        While He my restless heart is stilling,
        May I His mercy not forget!
        Come weal, come woe, my heart to test,
        His mercy is my only rest.

        10. I'll stand upon this firm foundation
        As long as I on earth remain;
        This shall engage my meditation
        While I the breath of life retain;
        And then, when face to face with Thee,
        I'll sing of mercy, great and free.

        1. My Savior sinners doth receive
        1. My Savior sinners doth receive
        Who find no rest and no salvation,
        To whom no man can comfort give,
        So great their guilt and condemnation;
        For whom the world is all too small,
        Their sins themselves and God appal;
        With whom the Law itself hath broken,
        On whom its judgment hath been spoken,--
        To them the Gospel hope doth give:
        My Savior sinners doth receive.

        2. A love more deep than mother-love,
        With which His heart was overflowing,
        Drew Him to earth from heaven above,
        On sinners boundless grace bestowing,
        He in their stead a curse became,
        He bore the across with all its shame;
        Brought full atonement by His suffering,
        Gave up His life for them an offering.
        This comfort doth the Gospel give:
        My Savior sinners doth receive.

        3. His loving bosom still remains
        A haven for the heavey-laden;
        Christ frees them from their guilty stains,
        Their burdened heart doth ease and gladden.
        He casts into the unfathomed sea
        The load of their iniquity;
        He gives assurance by His Spirit
        That they are saved through His own merit.
        Yea, they shall live who this believe:
        My Savior sinners doth receive.

        4. Say not: "My sins are far too great,
        His mercy I have scorned and slighted,
        Now my repentance is too late;
        I came not when His love invited."
        O trembling sinner, have no fear;
        In penitence to Christ draw near.
        Come now, though conscience still is chiding;
        Accept His mercy, e'er abiding.
        Come; blest are they who this believe:
        My Savior sinners doth receive.

        5. Oh, draw us ever unto Thee,
        Thou Friend of sinners, gracious Savior;
        Help us that we may fervently
        Desire Thy pardon, peace, and favor.
        When guilty conscience doth reprove,
        Reveal to us Thy heart of love.
        May we, our wretchedness beholding,
        See then Thy pardoning grace unfolding
        And say: "To God all glory be:
        My Savior, Christ, receiveth me."

        1. Dear Christians, one and all, rejoice,
        1. Dear Christians, one and all, rejoice,
        With exultation springing,
        And, with united heart and voice
        And holy rapture singing,
        Proclaim the wonders God hath done,
        How His right arm the victory won;
        Right dearly it hath cost Him.

        2. Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay,
        Death brooded darkly o'er me,
        Sin was my torment night and day,
        In sin my mother bore me;
        Yea, deep and deeper still I fell,
        Life had become a living hell,
        So firmly sin possessed me.

        3. My own good works availed me naught,
        No merit they attaining;
        Free will against God's judgment fought,
        Dead to all good remaining.
        My fears increased till sheer despair
        Left naught but death to be my share;
        The pangs of hell I suffered.

        4. But God beheld my wretched state
        Before the world's foundation,
        And, mindful of His mercies great,
        He planned my soul's salvation.
        A father's heart He turned to me,
        Sought my redemption fervently:
        He gave His dearest Treasure.

        5. He spoke to His beloved Son:
        'Tis time to have compassion.
        Then go, bright Jewel of My crown,
        And bring to man salvation;
        From sin and sorrow set him free,
        Slay bitter death for him that he
        May live with Thee forever.

        6. This Son obeyed His Father's will,
        Was born of virgin mother,
        And God's good pleasure to fulfill,
        He came to be my Brother.
        No garb of pomp or power He wore,
        A servant's form, like mine, He bore,
        To lead the devil captive.

        7.To me He spake: Hold fast to Me,
        I am thy Rock and Castle;
        Thy Ransom I Myself will be,
        For thee I strive and wrestle;
        For I am with thee, I am thine,
        And evermore thou shalt be Mine;
        The Foe shall not divide us.

        8. The Foe shall shed My precious blood,
        Me of My life bereaving.
        All this I suffer for thy good;
        Be steadfast and believing.
        Life shall from death the victory win,
        My innocence shall bear thy sin;
        So art thou blest forever.

        9. Now to My Father I depart,
        The Holy Spirit sending
        And, heavenly wisdom to impart,
        My help to thee extending.
        He shall in trouble comfort thee,
        Teach thee to know and follow Me,
        And in all truth shall guide thee.

        10. What I have done and taught, teach thou,
        My ways forsake thou never;
        So shall My kingdom flourish now
        And God be praised forever.
        Take heed lest men with base alloy
        The heavenly treasure should destroy;
        This counsel I bequeath thee.

        1. Just as I am, without one plea
        1. Just as I am, without one plea
        But that Thy blood was shed for me
        And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        2. Just as I am and waiting not
        To rid my soul of one dark blot,
        To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        3. Just as I am, though tossed about
        With many a conflict, many a doubt,
        Fightings and fears within, without,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        4. Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
        Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
        Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        5. Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
        Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
        Because Thy promise I believe,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        6. Just as I am; Thy love unknown
        Has broken every barrier down.
        Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
        O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

        1. Not what these hands have done
        1. Not what these hands have done
        Can save this guilty soul;
        Not what this toiling flesh has borne
        Can make my spirit whole.

        2. Not what I feel or do
        Can give me peace with God;
        Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
        Can bear my awe-full load.

        3. Thy work alone, O Christ,
        Can ease this weight of sin;
        Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
        Can give me peace within.

        4. Thy love to me, O God,
        Not mine, O Lord to Thee,
        Can rid me of this dark unrest
        And set my spirit free.

        5. Thy grace alone, O God,
        To me can pardon speak;
        Thy power alone, O Son of God,
        Can this sore bondage break.

        6. I bless the Christ of God,
        I rest on love divine,
        And with unfaltering lip and heart
        I call this Savior mine.

        1. Drawn to the Cross, which Thou hast blest
        1. Drawn to the Cross, which Thou hast blest
        With healing gifts for souls distrest,
        To find in Thee my life, my rest,
        Christ Crucified, I come.

        2. Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
        Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
        Yet now to Thee with contrite tears,
        Christ Crucified, I come.

        3. Wash me and take away each stain;
        Let nothing of my sin remain.
        For cleansing, though it be through pain,
        Christ Crucified, I come.

        4. And then for work to do for Thee,
        Which shall so sweet a service be
        That angels well might envy me,
        Christ Crucified, I come.

        1. Blessed are the sons of God,
        1. Blessed are the sons of God,
        They are bought with Christ's own blood;
        They are ransomed from the grave,
        Life eternal they shall have:
        With them numbered may we be
        Here and in eternity!

        2. They are justified by grace,
        They enjoy the Savior's peace;
        All their sins are washed away,
        They shall stand in God's great Day:
        With them numbered may we be
        Here and in eternity!

        3. They are lights upon the earth,
        Children of a heavenly birth;
        One with God, with Jesus one;
        Glory is in them begun:
        With them numbered may we be
        Here and in eternity!

        1. Blest is the man, forever blest,
        1. Blest is the man, forever blest,
        Whose guilt is pardoned by his God,
        Whose sins with sorrow are confessed
        And covered with his Savior's blood.

        2. Blest is the man to whom the Lord
        Imputes not his iniquities;
        He pleads no merit of reward
        And not on works but grace relies.

        3. From guile his heart and lips are free;
        His humble joy, his holy fear,
        With deep repentance well agree
        And join to prove his faith sincere.

        4. How glorious is that righteousness
        That hides and cancels all his sins,
        While bright the evidence of grace
        Thro all his life appears and shines!

        1. From God shall naught divide me,
        1. From God shall naught divide me,
        For He is true for aye
        And on my path will guide me,
        Who else should often stray.
        His right hand holdeth me;
        For me He truly careth,
        My burdens ever beareth
        Wherever I may be.

        2. When man's help and affection
        Shall unavailing prove,
        God grants me His protection
        And shows His pow'r and love.
        He helps in ev'ry need,
        From sin and shame redeems me,
        From chains and bonds reclaims me,
        Yea, e'en from death I'm freed.

        3. God shall be my Reliance
        In sorrow's darkest night;
        Its dread I bid defiance
        When He is at my right.
        I unto Him commend
        My body, soul, and spirit--
        They are His own by merit--
        All's well then at the end.

        4. Oh, praise Him, for He never
        Forgets our daily need;
        Oh, blest the hour whenever
        To Him our thoughts can speed;
        Yea, all the time we spend
        Without Him is but wasted,
        Till we His joy have tasted,
        The joy that hath no end.

        5. Yea, when the world shall perish
        With all its pride and power,
        Whatever worldlings cherish
        Shall vanish in that hour.
        But though in death they make
        The deepest grave our cover,
        When there our sleep is over,
        Our God will us awake.

        6. What though I here must suffer
        Distress and trials sore,
        I merit ways still rougher;
        And yet there is in store
        For me eternal bliss,
        Yea, pleasures without measure,
        Since Christ is now my Treasure
        And shall be evermore.

	1. My faith looks up to Thee,  
	1. My faith looks up to Thee,  
	Thou Lamb of Calvary,  
	Savior divine.  
	Now hear me while I pray;  
	Take all my guilt away;  
	Oh, let me from this day  
	Be wholly Thine!  
  
	2. May Thy rich grace impart  
	Strength to my fainting heart,  
	My zeal inspire!  
	As Thou hast died for me,  
	Oh, may my love to Thee  
	Pure, warm, and changeless be,  
	A living fire!  
  
	3. While life's dark maze I tread  
	And griefs around me spread,  
	Be Thou my Guide.  
	Bid darkness turn to day,  
	Wipe sorrow's tears away,  
	Nor let me ever stray  
	From Thee aside.  
  
	4. When ends life's transient dream,  
	When death's cold, sullen stream  
	Shall o'er me roll,  
	Blest Savior, then, in love,  
	Fear and distrust remove;  
	Oh, bear me safe above,  
	A ransomed soul!

        1. O God, Thou faithful God,
        1. O God, Thou faithful God,
        Thou Fountain ever flowing,
        Who good and perfect gifts
        In mercy art bestowing,
        Give me a healthy frame,
        And may I have within
        A conscience free from blame,
        A soul unhurt by sin!

        2. Grant Thou me strength to do
        With ready heart and willing
        Whate'er Thou shalt command,
        My calling here fulfilling;
        To do it when I ought,
        With all my might, and bless
        The work I thus have wrought,
        For Thou must give success.

        3. Oh, let me never speak
        What bounds of truth exceedeth;
        Grant that no idle word
        From out my mouth proceedeth;
        And then, when in my place
        I must and ought to speak,
        My words grant power and grace
        Lest I offend the weak.

        4. If dangers gather round,
        Still keep me calm and fearless;
        Help me to bear the cross
        When life is dark and cheerless;
        And let me win my foe
        With words and actions kind.
        When counsel I would know,
        Good counsel let me find.

        5.And let me with all men,
        As far as in me lieth,
        In peace and friendship live.
        And if Thy gift supplieth
        Great wealth and honor fair,
        Then this refuse me not,
        That naught be mingled there
        Of goods unjustly got.

        6. If Thou a longer life
        Hast here on earth decreed me;
        If Thou through many ills
        To age at length wilt lead me,
        Thy patience on me shed.
        Avert all sin and shame
        And crown my hoary head
        With honor free from blame.

        7. Let me depart this life
        Confiding in my Savior;
        Do Thou my soul receive
        That it may live forever;
        And let my body have
        A quiet resting-place
        Within a Christian grave;
        And let it sleep in peace.

        8. And on that solemn Day
        When all the dead are waking,
        Stretch o'er my grave Thy hand,
        Thyself my slumbers breaking.
        Then let me hear Thy voice,
        Change Thou this earthly frame,
        And bid me aye rejoice
        With those who love Thy name.

	1. Oh, for a faith that will not shrink 
	1. Oh, for a faith that will not shrink 
	Tho pressed by many a foe; 
	That will not tremble on the brink 
	Of poverty or woe; 
 
	2. That will not murmur nor complain 
	Beneath the chast'ning rod, 
	But in the hour of grief or pain 
	Can lean upon its God; 
 
	3. A faith that shines more bright and clear 
	When tempests rage without; 
	That, when in danger, knows no fear, 
	In darkness feels no doubt; 
 
	4. That bears unmoved the world's dread frown 
	Nor heeds its scornful smile; 
	That sin's wild ocean cannot drown 
	Nor Satan's arts beguile; 
 
	5. A faith that keeps the narrow way 
	Till life's last spark is fled 
	And with a pure and heavenly ray 
	Lights up the dying bed. 
 
	6. Lord give us such a faith as this; 
	And then, whate'er may come, 
	We'll taste e'en now the hallowed bliss 
	Of an eternal home. 

	1. O Love, who madest me to wear
	1. O Love, who madest me to wear
	The image of Thy Godhead here;
	Who soughtest me with tender care
	Thro all my wand'rings wild and drear,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

	2. O Love, who ere life's earliest dawn
	On me Thy choice hast gently laid;
	O Love, who here as man wast born
	And like to us in all things made,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

	3. O Love, who once in time wast slain,
	Pierced thro and thro with bitter woe;
	O Love, who, wrestling thus, didst gain
	That we eternal joy might know,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

	4. O Love, who thus hast bound me fast
	Beneath that easy yoke of Thine;
	Love, who hast conquered me at last,
	Enrapturing this heart of mine,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

	5. O Love, who lovest me for aye,
	Who for my soul dost ever plead;
	O Love, who didst my ransom pay,
	Whose power sufficeth in my stead,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

	6. O Love, who once shalt bid me rise
	From out this dying life of ours;
	O Love, who once above yon skies
	Shalt set me in the fadeless bowers,--
	O Love, I give myself to Thee,
	Thine ever, only Thine, to be.

        1. Renew me, O eternal Light,
        1. Renew me, O eternal Light,
        And let my heart and soul be bright,
        Illumined with the light of grace
        That issues from Thy holy face.

        2. Destroy in me the lust of sin,
        From all impureness make me clean.
        Oh, grant me power and strength, my God,
        To strive against my flesh and blood!

        3. Create in me a new heart, Lord,
        That gladly I obey Thy Word
        And naught but what Thou wilt, desire;
        With such new life my soul inspire.

        4. Grant that I only Thee may love
        And seek those things which are above
        Till I behold Thee face to face,
        O Light eternal, through Thy grace.

	1. Thee will I love, my Strength, my Tower; 
	1. Thee will I love, my Strength, my Tower; 
	Thee will I love, my Hope, my Joy; 
	Thee will I love with all my power, 
	With ardor time shall ne'er destroy. 
	Thee will I love, O Light Divine, 
	So long as life is mine. 
 
	2. Thee will I love, my Life, my Savior, 
	Who art my best and truest Friend; 
	Thee will I love and praise forever, 
	For never shall Thy kindness end; 
	Thee will I love with all my heart, 
	Thou my Redeemer art. 
 
	3. I thank Thee, Jesus, Sun from heaven, 
	Whose radiance hath bro't light to me; 
	I thank Thee, who hast richly given 
	All that could make me glad and free; 
	I thank Thee that my soul is healed 
	By what Thy lips revealed. 
 
	4. Oh, keep me watchful, then, and humble 
	And suffer me no more to stray; 
	Uphold me when my feet would stumble, 
	Nor let me loiter by the way. 
	Fill all my nature with Thy light, 
	O Radiance strong and bright! 
 
	5. Oh, teach me, Lord, to love Thee truly 
	With soul and body, head and heart, 
	And grant me grace that I may duly 
	Practice fore'er love's sacred art. 
	Grant that my every thought may be 
	Directed e'er to Thee. 
 
	6. Thee will I love, my Crown of gladness; 
	Thee will I love, my God and Lord, 
	Amid the darkest depths of sadness, 
	Not for the hope of high reward-- 
	For Thine own sake, O Light Divine, 
	So long as life is mine. 
 
	1. Take my life and let it be
	1. Take my life and let it be
	Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
	Take my moments and my days,
	Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

	2. Take my hands and let them move
	At the impulse of Thy love;
	Take my feet and let them be
	Swift and beautiful for Thee.

	3. Take my voice and let me sing
	Always, only, for my King;
	Take my lips and let them be
	Filled with messages from Thee.

	4. Take my silver and my gold,
	Not a mite would I withhold;
	Take my intellect and use
	Every power as Thou shalt choose.

	5. Take my will and make it Thine,
	It shall be no longer mine;
	Take my heart, it is Thine own,
	It shall be Thy royal throne.

	6. Take my love, my Lord, I pour
	At Thy feet its treasure-store;
	Take myself, and I will be
	Ever, only, all, for Thee.
 
        1. Praise to Thee and adoration,
        1. Praise to Thee and adoration,
        Blessed Jesus, Son of God,
        Who, to serve Thine own creation,
        Didst partake of flesh and blood.
        Teach me that I never may
        From Thy fold or pastures stray,
        But with zeal and joy exceeding
        Follow where Thy steps are leading.

        2. Let me never, Lord, forsake Thee,
        E'en though bitter pain and strife
        On my way shall overtake me;
        But may I through all my life
        Walk in fervent love to Thee,
        In all woes for comfort flee
        To Thy birth, Thy death, and Passion,
        Till I see Thy full salvation.

        1. O God, forsake me not!
        1. O God, forsake me not!
        Thy gracious presence lend me;
        Lead Thou Thy helpless child;
        Thy Holy Spirit send me
        That I my course may run.
        Be Thou my Light, my Lot,
        My Staff, my Rock, my Shield, --
        O God, forsake me not!

        2. O God, forsake me not!
        Take not Thy Spirit from me
        And suffer not the might
        Of sin to overcome me.
        Increase my feeble faith,
        Which Thou Thyself hast wrought.
        Be Thou my Strength and Power, --
        O God, forsake me not!

        3. O God, forsake me not!
        Lord, hear my supplication!
        In every evil hour
        Help me o'ercome temptation;
        And when the Prince of hell
        My conscience seeks to blot,
        Be Thou not far from me, --
        O God, forsake me not!

        4. O God, forsake me not!
        Thy mercy I'm addressing;
        O Father, God of Love,
        Grant me Thy heavenly blessing
        To do when duty calls
        What'er Thou didst allot,
        To do what pleaseth Thee, --
        O God, forsake me not!

        5. O God, forsake me not!
        Lord, I am Thine forever.
        Grant me true faith in Thee;
        Grant that I leave Thee never.
        Grant me a blessed end
        When my good fight is fought;
        Help me in life and death, --
        O God, forsake me not!

	1. Savior, Thy dying love
	1. Savior, Thy dying love
	Thou gavest me;
	Nor should I aught withhold,
	Dear Lord, from Thee.
	In love my soul would bow,
	My heart fulfil its vow,
	Some offering bring Thee now,
	Something for Thee.

	2. O'er the blest mercy-seat,
	Pleading for me,
	My feeble faith looks up,
	Jesus, to Thee.
	Help me my cross to bear,
	Thy wondrous love declare,
	Some song to raise or prayer,
	Something for Thee.

	3. Give me a faithful heart,
	Likeness to Thee,
	That each departing day
	Henceforth may see
	Some work of love begun,
	Some deed of kindness done,
	Some wanderer sought and won,
	Something for Thee.

	4. All that I am and have,
	Thy gifts so free,
	In joy, in grief, through life,
	Dear Lord, for Thee!
	And when Thy face I see,
	My ransomed soul shall be
	Through all eternity
	Something for Thee.
	1. Soul, what return has God, thy Savior,
	1. Soul, what return has God, thy Savior,
	For all He gives thee day by day?
	Oh, hast thou in thy gift a favor
	That can delight and please Him?--Say!
	The best of offerings He requires:
	Thy heart it is that He desires.

	2. Give unto God thy heart's affection,
	Who else can claim thee as His own?
	Should Satan hold thee in subjection?
	With him but pangs of hell are known.
	To Thee alone, O Lord divine,
	My heart and all I now resign.

	3. Accept the gift which Thou requirest,
	My heart and soul, O gracious God,
	The first-fruits Thou so much desirest,
	For which Thy Son paid with His blood.
	To Thee I willingly assign
	My heart, dear Lord, for it is Thine.

	4. Whom should I give my heart's affection
	But Thee, who gavest Thine to faith?
	Thy fervent love is my protection;
	Lord, Thou hast loved me unto death.
	My heart with Thine shall ever be
	One heart throughout eternity.

	1. I gave My life for thee,
	1. I gave My life for thee,
	My precious blood I shed,
	That thou might'st ransomed be
	And quickened from the dead.
	I gave My life for thee;
	What hast thou given for Me?

	2. I spent long years for thee
	In weariness and woe
	That an eternity
	Of joy thou mightest know.
	I spent long years for thee;
	Hast thou spent one for Me?

	3. My Father's home of light,
	My rainbow-circled throne,
	I left for earthly night,
	For wanderings sad and lone.
	I left it all for thee;
	Hast thou left aught for Me?

	4. I suffered much for thee,
	More than My tongue may tell,
	Of bitterest agony,
	To rescue thee from hell.
	I suffered much for thee;
	What canst thou bear for Me?

	5. And I have brought to thee
	Down from My home above
	Salvation full and free,
	My pardon and My love.
	Great gifts I brought to thee;
	What hast thou brought to Me?

	6. Oh, let thy life be given,
	Thy years for Me be spent,
	World's fetters all be riven,
	And joy with suffering blent!
	I gave Myself for thee:
	Give thou thyself to Me.
        1. Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me;
        1. Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me;
        No other wish I cherish.
        In life and death I cling to Thee;
        Oh, do not let me perish!
        Let not Thy grace from me depart
        And grant an ever patient heart
        To bear what Thou dost send me.

        2. Grant honor, truth, and purity,
        And love Thy Word to ponder;
        From all false doctrine keep me free.
        Bestow, both here and yonder,
        What serves my everlasting bliss;
        Preserve me from unrighteousness
        Throughout my earthly journey.

        3. When, at Thy summons, I must leave
        This vale of sin and sadness,
        Give me Thy grace, Lord, not to grieve,
        But to depart with gladness.
        To Thee my spirit I commend;
        O Lord, grant me a blessed end
        Through Jesus Christ, my Savior.

        1. Farewell I gladly bid Thee,
        1. Farewell I gladly bid Thee,
        False, evil world, farewell.
        Thy life is vain and sinful,
        With Thee I would not dwell.
        I long to be in heaven,
        In that untroubled sphere
        Where they will be rewarded
        Who served their God while here.

        2. By Thy good counsel lead me,
        O Son of God, my Stay;
        In each perplexing trial
        Help me, O Lord, I pray.
        Mine hour of sorrow shorten,
        Support my fainting heart,
        From every cross deliver,
        The crown of life impart.

        3. When darkness round me gathers,
        Thy name and cross, still bright,
        Deep in my heart are sparkling
        Like stars in blackest night.
        O heart, this image cherish:
        The Christ on Calvary,
        How patiently He suffered
        And shed His blood for me!

        4. Lord, hide my soul securely
        Deep in Thy wounded side;
        From every danger shield me
        And to Thy glory guide.
        He has been truly blessed
        Who reaches heaven above;
        He has found perfect healing
        Who rests upon Thy love.

        5. Lord, write my name, I pray Thee,
        Now in the Book of Life
        And with all true believers
        Take me where joys are rife.
        There let me bloom and flourish,
        Thy perfect freedom prove,
        And tell, as I adore Thee,
        How faithful was Thy love.

        1. Let us ever walk with Jesus,
        1. Let us ever walk with Jesus,
        Follow His example pure,
        Flee the world, which would deceive us
        And to sin our souls allure.
        Ever in His footsteps treading,
        Body here, yet soul above,
        Full of faith and hope and love,
        Let us do the Father's bidding.
        Faithful Lord, abide with me;
        Savior, lead, I follow Thee.

        2. Let us suffer here with Jesus,
        To His image, e'er conform;
        Heaven's glory soon will please us,
        Sunshine follow on the storm.
        Though we sow in tears of sorrow,
        We shall reap with heavenly joy;
        And the fears that now annoy
        Shall be laughter on the morrow.
        Christ, I suffer here with Thee;
        There, oh, share Thy joy with me!

        3. Let us also die with Jesus.
        His death from the second death,
        From our soul's destruction, frees us,
        Quickens us with life's glad breath.
        Let us mortify, while living,
        Flesh and blood and die to sin;
        And the grave that shuts us in
        Shall but prove the gate to heaven.
        Jesus, here I die to Thee
        There to live eternally.

        4. Let us gladly live with Jesus;
        Since He's risen from the dead,
        Death and grave must soon release us.
        Jesus, Thou art now our Head,
        We are truly Thine own members;
        Where Thou livest, there live we.
        Take and own us constantly,
        Faithful Friend, as Thy dear brethren.
        Jesus, here I live to Thee,
        Also there eternally.

        1. Jesus, lead Thou on
        1. Jesus, lead Thou on
        Till our rest is won;
        And although the way be cheerless,
        We will follow calm and fearless.
        Guide us by Thy hand
        To our fatherland.

        2. If the way be drear,
        If the foe be near,
        Let not faithless fears o'ertake us;
        Let not faith and hope forsake us;
        For through many a woe
        To our home we go.

        3. When we seek relief
        From a long-felt grief;
        When temptations come alluring,
        Make us patient and enduring;
        Show us that bright shore
        Where we weep no more.

        4. Jesus, lead Thou on
        Till our rest is won.
        Heavenly Leader, still direct us,
        Still support, control, protect us,
        Till we safely stand
        In our fatherland.

        1. From eternity, O God,
        1. From eternity, O God,
        In Thy Son Thou didst elect me;
        Therefore, Father, on life's road
        Graciously to heaven direct me;
        Send to me Thy Holy Spirit
        That His gifts I may inherit.

        2. Though alive, I'm dead in sin,
        Lost to all good things by nature.
        Holy Ghost, change me within,
        Make of me a new-born creature;
        For the flesh works ruination
        And can never gain salvation.

        3. Drive away the gloomy night
        Of my heart's perverse reflection;
        Quench all thoughts that are not right,
        Hold my reason in subjection;
        Grant that I from Thee, with yearning,
        Wisdom always may be learning.

        4. Oh, create a heart in me
        That in Thee, my God, believeth
        And o'er the iniquity
        Of my sins most truly grieveth.
        When dark hours of woe betide me,
        In the wounds of Jesus hide me.

        5. As a branch upon a vine
        In my blessed Lord implant me;
        Ever of my Head divine
        To remain a member grant me.
        Oh, let Him, my Lord and Savior,
        Be my Life and Love forever!

        6. Faith and hope and charity
        Graciously, O Father, give me;
        Be my Guardian constantly
        That the devil may not grieve me;
        Grant me humbleness and gladness,
        Peace and patience in my sadness.

        7. Help me speak what's right and good
        And keep silence on occasion;
        Help me pray, Lord, as I should,
        Help me bear my tribulation;
        Help me die and let my spirit
        Everlasting life inherit.

        1. May we Thy precepts, Lord, fulfil
        1. May we Thy precepts, Lord, fulfil
        And do on earth our Father's will
        As angels do above;
        Still walk in Christ, the living Way,
        With all Thy children and obey
        The law of Christian love.

        2. So may we join Thy name to bless,
        Thy grace adore, Thy power confess,
        From sin and strife to flee.
        One is our calling, one our name,
        The end of all our hopes the same,
        A crown of life with Thee.

        3. Spirit of Life, of Love, and Peace,
        Unite our hearts, our joy increase,
        Thy gracious help supply.
        To each of us the blessing give
        In Christian fellowship to live,
        In joyful hope to die.

        1. I walk in danger all the way.
        1. I walk in danger all the way.
        The thought shall never leave me
        That Satan, who has marked his prey,
        Is plotting to deceive me.
        This foe with hidden snares
        May seize me unawares
        If e'er I fail to watch and pray.
        I walk in danger all the way.

        2. I pass through trials all the way,
        With sin and ills contending;
        In patience I must bear each day
        The cross of God's own sending.
        Oft in adversity
        I know not where to flee;
        When storms of woe my soul dismay,
        I pass through trials all the way.

        3. Death doth pursue me all the way,
        Nowhere I rest securely;
        He comes by night, he comes by day,
        And takes his prey most surely.
        A failing breath, and I
        In death's strong grasp may lie
        To face eternity for aye.
        Death dost pursue me all the way.

        4. I walk with angels all the way,
        They shield me and befriend me;
        All Satan's power is held at bay
        When heavenly hosts attend me;
        They are my sure defense,
        All fear and sorrow, hence!
        Unharmed by foes, do what they may,
        I walk with angels all the way.

        5. I walk with Jesus all the way,
        His guidance never fails me;
        Within His wounds I find a stay
        When Satan's power assails me;
        And by His footsteps led,
        My path I safely tread.
        In spite of ills that threaten may,
        I walk with Jesus all the way.

        6. My walk is heavenward all the way;
        Await my soul, the morrow,
        When thou shalt find release for aye
        From all thy sin and sorrow.
        All worldly pomp, begone!
        To heaven I now press on.
        For all the world I would not stay;
        My walk is heavenward all the way.

        1. The man is ever blest
        1. The man is ever blest
        Who shuns the sinners ways,
        Among their counsels never stands,
        Nor takes the scorners place.

        2. But makes the Law of God
        His study and delight
        Amid the labors of the day
        And watches of the night.

        3. He like a tree shall thrive,
        With waters near the root;
        Fresh as the leaf his name shall live,
        His works are heavenly fruit.

        4. Not so the ungodly race,
        They no such blessings find;
        Their hopes shall flee like empty chaff
        Before the driving wind.

        5. How shall they bear to stand
        Before that judgment-seat
        Where all the saints at Christ's right hand
        In full assembly meet?

        6. He knows, and He approves,
        The way the righteous go;
        But sinners and their works shall meet
        A dreadful overflow.

        1. Lo, many shall come from the East and the West
        1. Lo, many shall come from the East and the West
        And sit at the feast of salvation
        With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the blest,
        Obeying the Lord's invitation.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        2. But they who have always resisted His grace
        And on their own virtue depended
        Shall then be condemned and cast out from His face,
        Eternally lost and unfriended.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        3. Oh, may we all hear when our Shepherd doth call
        In accents persuasive and tender,
        That, while there is time, we make haste, one and all,
        And find Him, our mighty Defender!
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        4. Oh, that we the throng of the ransomed may swell,
        To whom He hath granted remission!
        God graciously make us in heaven to dwell
        And save us from endless perdition.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        5. God grant that I may of His infinite love
        Remain in His merciful keeping
        And sit with the King at His table above
        When here in the grave I am sleeping.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        6. All trials are then like a dream that is past,
        Forgotten all trouble and sorrow;
        All questions and doubts have been answered at last;
        Then dawneth eternity's morrow.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        7. The heavens shall ring with an anthem more grand
        Than ever on earth was recorded;
        The blest of the Lord shall receive at His hand
        The crown to the victors awarded.
        Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

        1. Oh, that the Lord would guide my ways
        1. Oh, that the Lord would guide my ways
        To keep His statutes still!
        Oh, that my God would grant me grace
        To know and do His will!

        2. Order my footsteps by Thy Word
        And make my heart sincere;
        Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
        But keep my conscience clear.

        3. Assist my soul, too apt to stray,
        A stricter watch to keep;
        And should I e'er forget Thy way,
        Restore Thy wandering sheep.

        4. Make me to walk in Thy commands,--
        'Tis a delightful road,--
        Nor let my head or heart or hands
        Offend against my God.

        1. How can I thank Thee, Lord,
        1. How can I thank Thee, Lord,
        For all Thy loving-kindness,
        That Thou hast patiently
        Borne with me in my blindness?
        When dead in many sins
        And trespasses I lay,
        I kindled, holy God,
        Thine anger every day.

        2. It is Thy work alone
        That I am now converted;
        O'er Satan's work in me
        Thou hast Thy power asserted.
        Thy mercy and Thy grace
        That rise afresh each morn
        Have turned my stony heart
        Into a heart new-born.

        3. I could but grieve Thee, Lord,
        And with my sins displease Thee;
        Yet to atone for sin
        My works could not appease Thee.
        Though I could fall from grace
        And choose the way of sin,
        I had no strength to rise,
        A new life to begin.

        4. But Thou hast raised me up
        To joy and exultation
        And clearly shown the way
        That leads me to salvation.
        My sins are washed away,
        For this I thank thee, Lord;
        And with my heart and soul
        All dead works are abhorred.

        5. Grant that Thy Spirit's help
        To me be always given
        Lest I should fall again
        And lose the way to heaven;
        That He may give me strength
        In mine infirmity
        And e'er renew my heart
        To serve Thee willingly.

        6. Oh, guide and lead me, Lord,
        While here below I wander
        That I may follow Thee
        Till I shall see Thee yonder.
        For if I led myself,
        I soon would go astray;
        But if Thou leadest me,
        I keep the narrow way.

        7. O Father, God of Love,
        Hear Thou my supplication;
        O Savior, Son of God,
        Grant me Thy full salvation;
        And Thou, O Holy Ghost,
        Be Thou my faithful Guide
        That I may serve Thee here
        And there with Thee abide.

        1. My God, my Father, while I stray
        1. My God, my Father, while I stray
        Far from my home on life's rough way
        Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
        "Thy will be done."

        2. Though dark my path and sad my lot,
        Let me be still and murmur not
        Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
        "Thy will be done."

        3. What though in lonely grief I sigh
        For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
        Submissive still would I reply--
        "Thy will be done."

        4. Though Thou hast called me to resign
        What most I prized, it ne'er was mine;
        I have but yielded what was Thine--
        "Thy will be done."

        5. Should grief or sickness waste away
        My life in premature decay,
        My Father, still I strive to say,
        "Thy will be done."

        6. Let but my fainting heart be blest
        With Thy sweet Spirit for its Guest;
        My God, to Thee I leave the rest--
        "Thy will be done."

        7. Renew my will from day to day;
        Blend it with Thine and take away
        All that now makes it hard to say,
        "Thy will be done."

        8. Then, when on earth I breathe no more,
        The prayer, oft mixed with tears before,
        I'll sing upon a happier shore,
        "Thy will be done."

        1. O'er Jerusalem Thou weepest
        1. O'er Jerusalem Thou weepest
        In compassion, dearest Lord.
        Love divine, of love the deepest,
        O'er Thine erring Israel poured,
        Crieth out in bitter moan:
        "O loved city, hadst thou known
        This thy day of visitation,
        Thou wouldst not reject salvation."

        2. By the love Thy tears are telling,
        O Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
        Make my heart Thy temple-dwelling,
        Purged from every guilty stain.
        Oh, forgive, forgive, my sin!
        Cleanse me, cleanse me, Lord, within!
        I am Thine since Thou hast sought me,
        Since Thy precious blood hath bought me.

        3. O Thou Lord of my salvation,
        Grant my soul Thy blood-bought peace.
        By Thy tears of lamentation
        Bid my faith and love increase.
        Grant me grace to love Thy Word,
        Grace to keep the message heard,
        Grace to own Thee as my Treasure,
        Grace to love Thee without measure.

        1. My Jesus, as Thou wilt;
        1. My Jesus, as Thou wilt;
        Oh, may Thy will be mine!
        Into Thy hand of love
        I would my all resign.
        Through sorrow or through joy
        Conduct me as Thine own
        And help me still to say,
        My Lord, Thy will be done.

        2. My Jesus, as Thou wilt.
        If needy here and poor,
        Give me Thy people's bread,
        Thy Word, so rich and sure.
        This manna from above
        Let my soul feed upon;
        And if all else should fail,
        My Lord, Thy will be done.

        3. My Jesus, as Thou wilt.
        Though seen by many a tear,
        Let not my star of hope
        Grow dim or disappear.
        Since Thou on earth hast wept
        And sorrowed oft alone,
        If I must weep with Thee,
        My Lord, Thy will be done.

        4. My Jesus, as Thou wilt.
        When death itself draws nigh,
        Unto Thy wounded side
        For refuge I would fly
        And, clinging to Thee, go
        Where Thou before hast gone.
        My times are in Thy hand:
        My Lord, Thy will be done.

        5. My Jesus, as Thou wilt.
        All shall be well for me;
        Each changing future scene
        I gladly trust with Thee.
        Thus to my home above
        I travel calmly on
        And sing in life or death,
        My Lord, Thy will be done.

        1. Come, follow me, the Savior spake,
        1. Come, follow me, the Savior spake,
        All in My way abiding;
        Deny yourselves, the world forsake,
        Obey My call and guiding.
        Oh, bear the cross, whate'er betide,
        Take my example for your guide.

        2. I am the Light, I light the way,
        A godly life displaying;
        I bid you walk as in the day,
        I keep your feet from straying.
        I am the Way, and well I show
        How you must sojourn here below.

        3. My heart abounds in lowliness,
        My soul with love is glowing,
        And gracious words my lips express,
        With meekness overflowing.
        My heart, My mind, My strength, My all,
        To God I yield, on Him I call.

        4. I teach you how to shun and flee
        What harms your soul's salvation,
        Your heart from every guile to free,
        From sin and its temptation.
        I am the Refuge of the soul
        And lead you to your heavenly goal.

        5. Then let us follow Christ, our Lord,
        And take the cross appointed
        And, firmly clinging to His Word,
        In suffering be undaunted.
        For who bears not the battle's strain
        The crown of life shall not obtain.

        1. Savior, I follow on,
        1. Savior, I follow on,
        Guided by Thee,
        Seeing not yet the hand
        That leadeth me.
        Hushed be my heart and still,
        Fear I no further ill,
        Only to meet Thy will
        My will shall be.

        2. Riven the rock for me
        Thirst to relieve,
        Manna from heaven falls
        Fresh every eve.
        Never a want severe
        Causeth my eye a tear
        But Thou dost whisper near,
        "Only believe."

        3. Often to Marah's brink
        Have I been brought;
        Shrinking the cup to drink,
        Help I have sought;
        And with the prayer's ascent
        Jesus the branch hath rent,
        Quickly relief hath sent,
        Sweetening the draught.

        4. Savior, I long to walk
        Closer with Thee;
        Led by Thy guiding hand,
        Ever to be
        Constantly near Thy side,
        Quickened and purified,
        Living for Him who died
        Freely for me.

        1. Jesus, I my cross have taken,
        1. Jesus, I my cross have taken,
        All to leave and follow Thee;
        Destitute, despised, forsaken,
        Thou from hence my All shalt be.
        Perish every fond ambition,
        All I've sought or hoped or known;
        Yet how rich is my condition!
        God and heaven are still my own.

        2. Let the world despise and leave me,
        They have left my Savior, too.
        Human hearts and looks deceive me;
        Thou art not, like them, untrue.
        And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
        God of wisdom, love, and might,
        Foes may hate and friends may shun me;
        Show Thy face, and all is bright.

        3. Go, then, earthly fame and treasure!
        Come, disaster, scorn, and pain!
        In Thy service, pain is pleasure;
        With Thy favor, loss is gain.
        I have called Thee Abba, Father!
        I have stayed my heart on Thee.
        Storms may howl, and clouds may gather,
        All must work for good to me.

        4. Man may trouble and distress me,
        'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
        Life with trials hard may press me,
        Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
        Oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me
        While Thy love is left to me;
        Oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me
        Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

        5. Take, my soul, thy full salvation;
        Rise o'er sin and fear and care;
        Joy to find in every station,
        Something still to do or bear.
        Think what Spirit dwells within thee,
        What a Father's smile is thine,
        What a Savior died to win thee;
        Child of heaven, shouldst thou repine?

        6. Haste, then, on from grace to glory,
        Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
        Heaven's eternal day's before thee,
        God's own hand shall guide thee there.
        Soon shall close the earthly mission,
        Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
        Hope soon change to glad fruition,
        Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

        1. All depends on our possessing
        1. All depends on our possessing
        God's abundant grace and blessing,
        Though all earthly wealth depart.
        He who trusts with faith unshaken
        In His God is not forsaken
        And e'er keeps a dauntless heart.

        2. He who hitherto hath fed me
        And to many joys hath led me,
        Is and ever shall be mine.
        He who did so gently school me,
        He who still doth guide and rule me,
        Will remain my Help divine.

        3. Many spend their lives in fretting
        Over trifles and in getting
        Things that have no solid ground.
        I shall strive to win a treasure
        That will bring me lasting pleasure
        And that now is seldom found.

        4. When with sorrow I am stricken,
        Hope my heart anew will quicken,
        All my longing shall be stilled.
        To His loving-kindness tender
        Soul and body I surrender;
        For in Him alone I build.

        5. Well He knows what best to grant me;
        All the longing hopes that haunt me,
        Joy and sorrow, have their day.
        I shall doubt His wisdom never,--
        As God wills, so be it ever,--
        I to Him commit my way.

        6. If on earth my days He lengthen,
        He my weary soul will stengthen;
        All my trust in Him I place.
        Earthly wealth is not abiding,
        Like a stream away is gliding;
        Safe I anchor in His grace.

        1. The Lord my Shepherd is,
        1. The Lord my Shepherd is,
        I shall be well supplied.
        Since He is mine and I am His,
        What can I want beside?

        2. He leads me to the place
        Where heav'nly pasture grows,
        Where living waters gently pass
        And full salvation flows.

        3. If e'er I go astray,
        He doth my soul reclaim
        And guides me in His own right way
        For His most holy name.

        4. While He affords His aid,
        I cannot yield to fear;
        Though I should walk through death's dark shade,
        My Shepherd's with me there.

        5. Amid surrounding foes
        Thou dost my table spread;
        My cup with blessing overflows,
        And joy exults my head.

        6. The bounties of Thy love
        Shall crown my following days,
        Nor from Thy house will I remove
        Nor cease to speak Thy praise.

        1. How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
        1. How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
        Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
        What more can He say than to you He hath said
        Who unto the Savior for refuge have fled?

        2. In every condition, -- in sickness, in health,
        In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth,
        At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea, --
        The Lord, the Almighty, they strength e'er shall be.

        3. "Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not dismayed,
        For I am thy God and will still give thee aid;
        I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
        Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

        4. "When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
        The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
        For I will be with thee thy troubles to bless
        And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

        5. "When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
        My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply.
        The flames shall not hurt thee; I only design
        Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

        6. "E'en down to old age all My people shall prove
        My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
        And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,
        Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.

        7. "The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
        I will not, I will not, desert to his foes;
        That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
        I'll never, no never, no never, forsake!"

        1. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
        1. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
        Trusting only Thee;
        Trusting Thee for full salvation,
        Great and free.

        2. I am trusting Thee for pardon;
        At Thy feet I bow,
        For Thy grace and tender mercy
        Trusting now.

        3. I am trusting Thee for cleansing
        In the crimson flood;
        Trusting Thee to make me holy
        By Thy blood.

        4. I am trusting Thee to guide me;
        Thou alone shalt lead,
        Ev'ry day and hour supplying
        All my need.

        5. I am trusting Thee for power;
        Thine can never fail.
        Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
        Must prevail.

        6. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
        Never let me fall.
        I am trusting Thee forever
        And for all.

        1. Lord, Thee I love with all my heart;
        1. Lord, Thee I love with all my heart;
        I pray Thee ne'er from me depart,
        With tender mercies cheer me.
        Earth has no pleasure I would share,
        Yea, heaven itself were void and bare
        If Thou, Lord, wert not near me.
        And should my heart for sorrow break,
        My trust in Thee no one could shake.
        Thou art the Portion I have sought;
        Thy precious blood my soul has bought.
        Lord Jesus Christ,
        My God and Lord, my God and Lord,
        Forsake me not! I trust Thy Word.

        2. Yea, Lord, 'twas Thy rich bounty gave
        My body, soul, and all I have
        In this poor life of labor.
        Lord, grant that I in every place
        May glorify Thy lavish grace
        And serve and help my neighbor.
        Let no false doctrine me beguile
        And Satan not my soul defile.
        Give strength and patience unto me
        To bear my cross and follow Thee.
        Lord Jesus Christ,
        My God and Lord, my God and Lord,
        In death Thy comfort still afford.

        3. Lord, let at last Thine angels come,
        To Abram's bosom bear me home,
        That I may die unfearing;
        And in its narrow chamber keep
        My body safe in peaceful sleep
        Until Thy reappearing.
        And then from death awaken me
        That these mine eyes with joy may see,
        O Son of God, Thy glorious face,
        My Savior and my Fount of grace,
        Lord Jesus Christ,
        My prayer attend, my prayer attend,
        And I will praise Thee without end.

        1. What is the world to me
        1. What is the world to me
        With all its vaunted pleasure
        When Thou, and Thou alone,
        Lord Jesus, art my Treasure!
        Thou only, dearest Lord,
        My soul's Delight shalt be;
        Thou art my Peace, my Rest,-
        What is the world to me!

        2. The would is like a cloud
        And like a vapor fleeting,
        A shadow that declines,
        Swift to its end retreating.
        My Jesus doth abide,
        Though all things fade and flee;
        My everlasting Rock,-
        What is the world to me!

        3. The world seeks to be praised
        And honored by the mighty,
        Yet never once reflects
        That they are frail and flighty.
        But what I truly prize
        Above all things is He,
        My Jesus, He alone,-
        What is the world to me!

        4. The world seeks after wealth
        And all that Mammon offers,
        Yet never is content
        Though gold should fill it coffers.
        I have a higher good,
        Content with it I'll be:
        My Jesus is my Wealth,-
        What is the world to me!

        5. The world is sorely grieved
        Whenever it is slighted
        Or when its hollow fame
        And honor have been blighted.
        Christ, Thy reproach I bear
        Long as it pleaseth Thee;
        I'm honored by my Lord,-
        What is the world to me!

        6. The world with wanton pride
        Exalts its sinful pleasures
        And for them foolishly
        Gives up the heavenly treasures.
        Let others love the world
        With all its vanity;
        I love the Lord, my God,-
        What is the world to me!

        7. The world abideth not;
        Lo, like a flash 'twill vanish;
        With all it gorgeous pomp
        Pale death it cannot banish;
        Its riches pass away,
        And all its joys must flee;
        But Jesus doth abide,-
        What is the world to me!

        8. What is the world to me!
        My Jesus is my Treasure,
        My Life, my Health, my Wealth,
        My Friend, my Love, my Pleasure,
        My Joy, my Crown, my All,
        My Bliss eternally.
        Once more, then, I declare:
        What is the world to me!

        1. The King of Love my Shepherd is,
        1. The King of Love my Shepherd is,
        Whose goodness faileth never;
        I nothing lack if I am His
        And He is mine forever.

        2. Where streams of living water flow,
        My ransomed soul He leadeth,
        And where the verdant pastures grow,
        With food celestial feedeth.

        3. Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
        But yet in love He sought me
        And on His shoulder gently laid
        And home, rejoicing, brought me.

        4. In death's dark vale I fear no ill,
        With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
        Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
        Thy cross before to guide me.

        5. Thou spreadst a table in my sight,
        Thy unction grace bestoweth;
        And, oh! the transport of delight
        With which my cup o'erfloweth.

        6. And so through all the length of days
        Thy goodness faileth never.
        Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
        Within Thy house forever!

        1. Jesus, my Truth, my Way,
        1. Jesus, my Truth, my Way,
        My sure, unerring Light,
        On Thee my feeble soul I stay,
        Which Thou wilt lead aright.

        2. My Wisdom and my Guide,
        My Counselor Thou art;
        Oh, let me never leave Thy side
        Nor from Thy paths depart!

        3. Thou seest my feebleness;
        Jesus, be Thou my Power,
        My Help and Refuge in distress,
        My Fortress and my Tower.

        4. Give me to trust in Thee;
        Be Thou my sure Abode;
        My Horn and Rock and Buckler be,
        My Savior and my God.

        5. Myself I cannot save,
        Myself I cannot keep;
        But strength in Thee I surely have,
        Whose eyelids never sleep.

        6. My soul to Thee alone
        Now, therefore, I commend.
        Thou, Jesus, having loved Thine own,
        Wilt love me to the end.

        1. O God of Jacob, by whose hand
        1. O God of Jacob, by whose hand
        Thy people still are fed;
        Who through this weary pilgrimage
        Hast all our fathers led,

        2. Our vows, our prayers, we now present
        Before Thy throne of grace;
        God of our fathers, be the God
        Of their succeeding race.

        3. Through each perplexing path of life
        Our wandering footsteps guide;
        Give us each day our daily bread
        And raiment fit provide.

        4. Oh, spread Thy covering wings around
        Till all our wanderings cease
        And at our Father's loved abode
        Our souls arrive in peace.

        5. Now with the humble voice of prayer
        Thy mercy we implore;
        Then with a grateful voice of praise
        Thy goodness we'll adore.

        1. My spirit on Thy care,
        1. My spirit on Thy care,
        Blest Savior, I recline;
        Thou wilt not leave me to despair,
        For Thou art Love divine.

        2. In Thee I place my trust,
        On Thee I calmly rest;
        I know Thee good, I know Thee just,
        And count Thy choice the best.

        3. Whate'er events betide,
        Thy will they all perform;
        Safe in Thy breast my head I hide
        Nor fear the coming storm.

        4. Let good or ill befall,
        It must be good for me;
        Secure of having Thee in all,
        Of having all in Thee.

        1. The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
        1. The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
        He makes me down to lie
        In pastures green; He leadeth me
        The quiet waters by.

        2. My soul He doth restore again
        And me to walk doth make
        Within the paths of righteousness,
        E'en for His own name's sake.

        3. Yea, tho I walk in death's dark vale,
        Yet will I fear no ill;
        For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
        And staff me comfort still.

        4. My table Thou hast furnished
        In presence of my foes;
        My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
        And my cup overflows.

        5. Goodness and mercy, all my life,
        Shall surely follow me;
        And in God's house forevermore
        My dwelling place shall be.

        1. Who trusts in God a strong abode
        1. Who trusts in God a strong abode
        In heaven and earth possesses;
        Who looks in love to Christ above,
        No fear his heart oppresses.
        In Thee alone, dear Lord, we own
        Sweet hope and consolation,
        Our Shield from foes, our Balm for woes,
        Our great and sure Salvation.

        2. Though Satan's wrath beset our path
        And worldly scorn assail us,
        While Thou art near, we will not fear;
        Thy strength shall never fail us.
        Thy rod and staff shall keep us safe
        And guide our steps forever;
        Nor shades of death nor hell beneath
        Our souls from Thee shall sever.

        3. In all the strife of mortal life
        Our feet shall stand securely;
        Temptation's hour shall lose its power,
        For Thou shalt guard us surely.
        O God, renew with heavenly dew
        Our body, soul, and spirit
        Until we stand at Thy right hand
        Through Jesus saving merit.

        1. Almighty Father, heaven and earth
        1. Almighty Father, heaven and earth
        With lavish wealth before Thee bow;
        Those treasures owe to Thee their birth,
        Creator, Ruler, Giver, Thou.

        2. The wealth of earth, of sky, of sea,
        The gold, the silver, sparkling gem,
        The waving corn, the bending tree,
        Are Thine; to us Thou lendest them.

        3. To Thee, as early morning's dew,
        Our praises, alms, and prayer shall rise
        As rose, when joyous earth was new,
        Faith's patriarchal sacrifice.

        4. We, Lord, would lay, at Thy behest
        The costliest offerings on Thy shrine;
        But when we give, and give our best,
        We give Thee only what is Thine.

        5. O Father, whence all blessings come;
        O Son, Dispenser of God's store;
        O Spirit, bear our offerings home:
        Lord, make them Thine forevermore.

        1. O God of mercy, God of might,
        1. O God of mercy, God of might,
        In love and pity infinite,
        Teach us, as ever, in Thy sight,
        To live our life to Thee.

        2. And Thou, who cam'st on earth to die
        That fallen man might live thereby,
        Oh, hear us; for to Thee we cry,
        In hope, O Lord, to Thee.

        3. Teach us the lesson Thou hast taught,
        To feel for those Thy blood hath bought
        That every word and deed and thought
        May work a work for Thee.

        4. All are redeemed, both far and wide,
        Since Thou, O Lord, for all hast died.
        Oh, teach us, whatsoe'er betide,
        To love them all in Thee!

        5. In sickness, sorrow, want, or care,
        Whate'er it be, 'tis ours to share;
        May we, where help is needed, there
        Give help as unto Thee!

        6. And may Thy Holy Spirit move
        All those who live to live in love
        Till Thou shalt greet in heaven above
        All those who live to Thee.

        1. Lord, lead the way the Savior went,
        1. Lord, lead the way the Savior went,
        By lane and cell obscure,
        And let love's treasure still be spent,
        Like His, upon the poor.

        2. Like Him, through scenes of deep distress,
        Who bore the world's sad weight,
        We in their crowded loneliness
        Would seek the desolate.

        3. For Thou hast placed us side by side
        In this wide world of ill;
        And that Thy followers may be tried,
        The poor are with us still.

        4. Mean are all offerings we can make;
        But Thou hast taught us, Lord,
        If given for the Savior's sake,
        They lose not their reward.

        1. We give Thee but Thine own,
        1. We give Thee but Thine own,
        Whate'er the gift may be;
        All that we have is Thine alone,
        A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

        2. May we Thy bounties thus
        As stewards true receive
        And gladly, as Thou blessest us,
        To Thee our first-fruits give!

        3. Oh, hearts are bruised and dead,
        And homes are bare and cold,
        And lambs for whom the Shepherd bled
        Are straying from the fold.

        4. To comfort and to bless,
        To find a balm for woe,
        To tend the lone and fatherless,
        Is angels work below.

        5. The captive to release,
        To God the lost to bring,
        To teach the way of life and peace,
        It is a Christlike thing.

        6. And we believe Thy Word,
        Though dim our faith may be:
        Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,
        We do it unto Thee.

        1. Lord of Glory, who hast bought us
        1. Lord of Glory, who hast bought us
        With Thy life-blood as the price,
        Never grudging for the lost ones
        That tremendous sacrifice;
        And with that hast freely given
        Blessings countless as the sand
        To the unthankful and the evil
        With Thine own unsparing hand;

        2. Grant us hearts, dear Lord, to yield Thee
        Gladly, freely, of Thine own;
        With the sunshine of Thy goodness
        Melt our thankless hearts of stone
        Till our cold and selfish natures,
        Warmed by Thee, at length believe
        That more happy and more blessed
        'Tis to give than to receive.

        3. Wondrous honor hast Thou given
        To our humblest charity
        In Thine own mysterious sentence,
        "Ye have done it unto Me."
        Can it be, O gracious Master,
        Thou dost deign for alms to sue,
        Saying by Thy poor and needy,
        "Give as I have given to you"?

        4. Yes, the sorrow and the sufferings
        Which on every hand we see
        Channels are for tithes and offerings
        Due by solemn right to Thee;
        Right of which we may not rob Thee,
        Debt we may not choose but pay,
        Lest that face of love and pity
        Turn from us another day.

        5. Lord of Glory, who hast bought us
        With Thy life-blood as the price,
        Never grudging for the lost ones
        That tremendous sacrifice,
        Give us faith to trust Thee boldly,
        Hope, to stay our souls on Thee;
        But, oh! best of all Thy graces,
        Give us Thine own charity.

        1. O Lord of heaven and earth and sea,
        1. O Lord of heaven and earth and sea,
        To Thee all praise and glory be.
        How shall we show our love to Thee,
        Who givest all?

        2. The golden sunshine, vernal air,
        Sweet flowers and fruit, Thy love declare.
        When harvests ripen, Thou art there,
        Who givest all.

        3. For peaceful homes and healthful days,
        For all the blessings earth displays,
        We owe Thee thankfulness and praise,
        Who givest all.

        4. Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,
        But gav'st Him for a world undone,
        And freely with that Blessed One
        Thou givest all.

        5. Thou giv'st the Spirit's holy dower,
        Spirit of Life and Love and Power,
        And dost His sevenfold graces shower
        Upon us all.

        6. For souls redeemed, for sins forgiven,
        For means of grace and hopes of heaven,
        What can to Thee, O Lord, be given
        Who givest all?

        7. We lose what on ourselves we spend;
        We have as treasure without end
        Whatever Lord, to Thee we lend,
        Who givest all;

        8. To Thee, from whom we all derive
        Our life, our gifts, our power to give.
        Oh, may we ever with Thee live,
        Who givest all!

	1. Rise! To arms! With prayer employ you,
	1. Rise! To arms! With prayer employ you,
	O Christians, lest the Foe destroy you,
	For Satan has designed your fall.
	Wield God's Word, a weapon glorious!
	Against each foe you'll be victorious;
	Our God will set you o'er them all.
	Is Satan strong and fell?
	Here is Immanuel.
	Sing hosanna!
	The strong ones yield,
	With Christ our Shield,
	And we as conqueror's hold the field.

	2. Cast afar this world's vain pleasures,
	Aye, boldly fight for heavenly treasures,
	And steadfast be in Jesus might.
	He will help, whate'er betide you,
	And naught will harm with Christ beside you;
	By faith you'll conquer in the fight.
	Then shame, thou weary soul!
	Look forward to the goal:
	There joy waits thee. 
	The race, then, run;
	The combat done,
	Thy crown of glory will be won.

	3. Wisely fight, for time is fleeting,
	The hours of grace are fast retreating;
	Short, short, is this our earthly way.
	Then the trump the dead is waking
	And sinners all with fear are quaking,
	With joy the saints will greet that Day.
	Bless God, our triumph's sure,
	Tho long we did endure
	Scorn and trial.
	Thou, Son of God,
	To Thine abode
	Wilt lead the way Thyself hast trod.

	4. Jesus, all Thy children cherish
	And keep them that they never perish
	Whom Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.
	Let new life to us be given
	That we may look to Thee in heaven
	Whenever fearful is our mood.
	Thy spirit on us pour
	That we may love Thee more--
	Hearts o'erflowing;
	And then will we 
	Be true to Thee
	In death and life eternally. Amen.

	1. Am I a solder of the Cross, 
	1. Am I a solder of the Cross, 
	A foll'wer of the Lamb,
	And shall I fear to own 
	His cause Or blush to speak His name?
	
	2. Must I be carried to the skies 
	On flow'ry beds of ease
	While others fought to win the prize 
	And sailed thro bloody seas?

	3. Are there no foes for me to face? 
	Must I not stem the flood?
	Is this vile world a friend to grace 
	To help me on to God?

	4. Sure I must fight if I would reign; 
	Increase my courage, Lord!
	I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
	Supported by Thy Word.

	5. Thy saints in all this glorious war
	Shall conquer though they die;
	They see the triumph from afar
	With faith's discerning eye.

	6. When that illustrious Day shall rise
	And all Thine armies shine
	In robes of victory through the skies,
	The glory shall be Thine.

        1. Rise, my soul, to watch and pray,
        1. Rise, my soul, to watch and pray,
        From thy sleep awaken;
        Be not by the evil day
        Unawares o'ertaken.
        For the Foe,
        Well we know,
        Oft his harvest reapeth
        While the Christian sleepeth.

        2. Watch against the devil's snares
        Lest asleep he find thee;
        For indeed no pains he spares
        To deceive and blind thee.
        Satan's prey
        Oft are they
        Who secure are sleeping
        And no watch are keeping.

        3. Watch! Let not the wicked world
        With its pow'r defeat thee.
        Watch lest with her pomp unfurled
        She betray and cheat thee.
        Watch and see
        Lest there be
        Faithless friends to charm thee,
        Who but seek to harm thee.

        4. Watch against thyself, my soul,
        Lest with grace thou trifle;
        Let not self thy tho'ts control
        Nor God's mercy stifle.
        Pride and sin
        Lurk within
        All thy hopes to scatter;
        Heed not when they flatter.

        5. But while watching, also pray
        To the Lord unceasing.
        He will free thee, be thy stay,
        Strength and faith increasing.
        O Lord, bless
        In distress
        And let nothing swerve me
        From the will to serve Thee.

        6. Therefore let us watch and pray,
        Knowing He will hear us
        As we see from day to day
        Dangers ever near us,
        And the end
        Doth impend--
        Our redemption neareth
        When the Lord appeareth.

        1. Fight the good fight With all thy might;
        1. Fight the good fight With all thy might;
        Christ is thy Strength and Christ thy Right.
        Lay hold on life, and it shall be
        Thy joy and crown eternally.

        2. Run the straight race Thro God's good grace;
        Lift up thine eyes and seek His face.
        Life with its way before us lies;
        Christ is the Path and Christ the Prize.

        3. Cast care aside; Upon thy Guide
        Lean, and His mercy will provide;
        Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove
        Christ is its Life and Christ its Love.

        4. Faint not nor fear, His arms are near;
        He changeth not, and thou art dear.
        Only believe, and thou shalt see
        That Christ is All in all to thee. 

        1. Brief life is here our portion;
        1. Brief life is here our portion;
        Brief sorrow, short-lived care.
        The life that knows no ending,
        The tearless life, is there.
        O happy retribution:
        Short toil, eternal rest;
        For mortals and for sinners
        A mansion with the blest!

        2. And now we fight the battle,
        But then shall wear the crown
        Of full and everlasting
        And passionless renown;
        And now we watch and struggle,
        And now we live in hope,
        And Zion in her anguish
        With Babylon must cope.

        3. But He whom now we trust in
        Shall then be seen and known;
        And they that know and see Him
        Shall have Him for their own.
        And there is David's fountain
        And life in fullest glow;
        And there the light is golden,
        And milk and honey flow.

        4. The morning shall awaken,
        And shadows shall decay,
        And each true-hearted servant
        Shall shine as doth the day.
        There God, our King and Portion,
        In fulness of His grace
        Shall we behold forever
        And worship face to face.

        5. O sweet and blessed country,
        The home of God's elect!
        O sweet and blessed country
        That eager hearts expect!
        Jesus, in mercy bring us
        To that dear land of rest,
        Who art, with God the Father
        And Spirit, ever blest.

        1. My soul, be on thy guard;
        1. My soul, be on thy guard;
        Ten thousand foes arise,
        And hosts of sin are pressing hard
        To draw thee from the skies.

        2. Oh, watch and fight and pray,
        The battle ne'er give o'er;
        Renew it boldly ev'ry day
        And help divine implore.

        3. Ne'er think the vict'ry won
        Nor lay thine armor down;
        Thine arduous work will not be done
        Till thou obtain the crown.

        4. Fight on, my soul, till death
        Shall bring thee to thy God;
        He'll take thee at thy parting breath
        To His divine abode.

        1. Soldiers of Christ, arise
        1. Soldiers of Christ, arise
        And put your armor on,
        Strong in the strength which God supplies
        Thro His eternal Son;

        2. Strong in the Lord of hosts
        And in His mighty pow'r.
        Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
        Is more than conqueror.

        3. Stand, then, in His great might,
        With all His strength endued;
        But take, to arm you for the fight,
        The panoply of God,

        4. That, having all things done
        And all your conflicts past,
        Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone
        And stand entire at last.

        5. From strength to strength go on,
        Wrestle and fight and pray;
        Tread all the powers of darkness down
        And win the well-fought day.

        1. Stand up!--stand up for Jesus,
        1. Stand up!--stand up for Jesus,
        Ye soldiers of the Cross!
        Lift high His royal banner,
        It must not suffer loss.
        From vict'ry unto vict'ry
        His army shall He lead
        Till ev'ry foe is vanquished
        And Christ is Lord indeed.

        2. Stand up!--stand up for Jesus!
        The trumpet-call obey;
        Forth to the mighty conflict
        In this His glorious day!
        Ye that are men, now serve Him
        Against unnumbered foes;
        Let courage rise with danger
        And strength to strength oppose.

        3. Stand up!--stand up for Jesus!
        Stand in His strength alone;
        The arm of flesh will fail you,
        Ye dare not trust your own.
        Put on the Gospel armor,
        Each piece put on with prayer;
        Where duty calls or danger,
        Be never wanting there.

        4. Stand up!--stand up for Jesus!
        The strife will not be long;
        This day the noise of battle,
        The next, the victor's song.
        To him that overcometh
        A crown of life shall be;
        He with the King of Glory
        Shall reign eternally.

        1. The Son of God goes forth to war
        1. The Son of God goes forth to war
        A kingly crown to gain.
        His blood-red banner streams afar;
        Who follows in His train?
        Who best can drink His cup of woe,
        Triumphant over pain,
        Who patient bears his cross below--
        He follows in His train.

        2. The martyr first whose eagle eye
        Could pierce beyond the grave,
        Who saw His Master in the sky
        And called on Him to save.
        Like Him, with pardon on His tongue,
        In midst of mortal pain,
        He prayed for them that did the wrong--
        Who follows in his train?

        3. A glorious band, the chosen few,
        On whom the Spirit came,
        Twelve valiant saints; their hope they knew
        And mocked the cross and flame.
        They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
        The lion's gory mane;
        They bowed their necks the death to feel--
        Who follows in their train?

        4. A noble army, men and boys,
        The matron and the maid,
        Around the Savior's throne rejoice,
        In robes of light arrayed.
        They climbed the steep ascent of heav'n
        Thro peril, toil, and pain.
        O God, to us may grace be giv'n
        To follow in their train!

        1. We are the Lord's; His all-sufficient merit,
        1. We are the Lord's; His all-sufficient merit,
        Sealed on the cross, to us this grace accords.
        We are the Lord's and all things shall inherit; 
        Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.

        2. We are the Lord's; then let us gladly tender
        Our souls to Him in deeds, not empty words.
        Let heart and tongue and life combine to render
        No doubtful witness that we are the Lord's.

        3. We are the Lord's; no darkness brooding o'er us
        Can make us tremble while this star affords
        A steady light along the path before us--
        Faith's full assurance that we are the Lord's.

        4. We are the Lord's; no evil can befall us
        In the dread hour of life's fast-loos'ning cords;
        No pangs of death shall even then appal us.
        Death we shall vanquish, for we are the Lord's.

        1. Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
        1. Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
        Unuttered or exprest,
        The motion of a hidden fire
        That trembles in the breast.

        2. Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
        The falling of a tear,
        The upward glancing of an eye,
        When none but God is near.

        3. Prayer is the simplest form of speech
        That infant lips can try;
        Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
        The Majesty on high.

        4. Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
        Returning from his ways,
        While angels in their songs rejoice
        And cry, "Behold, he prays!"

        5. Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
        The Christian's native air,
        His watchword at the gates of death--
        He enters heaven with prayer.

        6. The saints in prayer appear as one
        In word and deed and mind,
        While with the Father and the Son
        Sweet fellowship they find.

        7. Nor prayer is made by man alone--
        The Holy Spirit pleads,
        And Jesus on the eternal throne
        For sinners intercedes.

        8. O Thou by whom we come to God,
        The Life, the Truth, the Way,
        The path of prayer Thyself hast trod--
        Lord, teach us how to pray.

        1. Our heav'nly Father, hear
        1. Our heav'nly Father, hear
        The prayer we offer now.
        Thy name be hallowed far and near;
        To Thee all nations bow.

        2. Thy kingdom come; Thy will
        On earth be done in love
        As saints and seraphim fulfil
        Thy holy will above.

        3. Our daily bread supply
        While by Thy word we live.
        The guilt of our iniquity
        Forgive as we forgive.

        4. From dark temptation's power,
        From Satan's wiles, defend.
        Deliver in the evil hour
        And guide us to the end.

        5. Thine shall forever be
        Glory and power divine;
        The scepter, throne, and majesty
        Of heaven and earth are Thine.
        1. Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat
        1. Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat
        Where Jesus answers prayer;
        There humbly fall before His feet,
        For none can perish there.

        2. Thy promise is my only plea,
        With this I venture nigh;
        Thou callest burdened souls to Thee,
        And such, O Lord, am I.

        3. Bowed down beneath a load of sin,
        By Satan sorely pressed,
        By wars without and fears within,
        I come to Thee for rest.

        4. Be Thou my Shield and Hiding-place,
        That, sheltered near Thy side,
        I may my fierce Accuser face
        And tell him Thou hast died.

        5. O wondrous Love, to bleed and die,
        To bear the cross and shame,
        That guilty sinners such as I
        Might plead Thy gracious name!

        1. What a Friend we have in Jesus,
        1. What a Friend we have in Jesus,
        All our sins and griefs to bear!
        What a privilege to carry
        Ev'rything to God in prayer!
        Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
        Oh, what needless pain we bear,
        All because we do not carry
        Ev'rything to God in prayer!

        2. Have we trials and temptations?
        Is there trouble anywhere?
        We should never be discouraged,
        Take it to the Lord in prayer.
        Can we find a Friend so faithful
        Who will all our sorrows share?
        Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness--
        Take it to the Lord in prayer.

        3. Are we weak and heavy laden,
        Cumbered with a load of care?
        Precious Savior, still our Refuge--
        Take it to the Lord in prayer.
        Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
        Take it to the Lord in prayer;
        In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
        Thou wilt find a solace there.

        1. Our Father, Thou in heaven above,
        1. Our Father, Thou in heaven above,
        Who biddest us to dwell in love,
        As brethren of one family,
        To cry in every need to Thee,
        Teach us no thoughtless word to say,
        But from our inmost heart to pray.

        2. Thy name be hallowed. Help us, Lord,
        In purity to keep Thy Word,
        That to the glory of thy name
        We walk before Thee free from blame.
        Let no false doctrine us pervert;
        All poor, deluded souls convert.

        3. Thy kingdom come. Thine let it be
        In time and in eternity.
        Let Thy good Spirit e'er be nigh
        Our hearts with graces to supply.
        Break Satan's power, defeat his rage;
        Preserve Thy Church from age to age.

        4. Thy gracious will on earth be done
        As 'tis in heaven before Thy throne;
        Obedience in our weal and woe
        And patience in all grief bestow.
        Curb flesh and blood and every ill
        That sets itself against Thy will.

        5. Give us this day our daily bread
        And let us all be clothed and fed.
        From war and strife be our Defense,
        From famine and from pestilence,
        That we may live in godly peace,
        Free from all care and avarice.

        6. Forgive our sins, Lord, we implore,
        Remove from us their burden sore,
        As we their trespasses forgive
        Who by offenses us do grieve.
        Thus let us dwell in charity
        And serve our brother willingly.

        7. Into temptation lead us not.
        When evil foes against us plot
        And vex our souls on every hand,
        Oh, give us strength that we may stand
        Firm in the faith, a well-armed host,
        Through comfort of the Holy Ghost!

        8. From evil, Lord, deliver us;
        The times and days are perilous.
        Redeem us from eternal death,
        And when we yield our dying breath,
        Console us, grant us calm release,
        And take our souls to Thee in peace.

        9. Amen, that is, So shall it be.
        Confirm our faith and hope in Thee
        That we may doubt not, but believe
        What here we ask we shall receive.
        Thus in Thy name and at Thy word
        We say: Amen. Oh, hear us, Lord! Amen.

        1. Come, my soul, thy suit prepare,
        1. Come, my soul, thy suit prepare,
        Jesus loves to answer prayer;
        He Himself has bid thee pray,
        Therefore will not say thee nay.

        2. Thou art coming to a King,
        Large petitions with thee bring;
        For His grace and pow'r are such
        None can ever ask too much.

        3. With my burden I begin:
        Lord, remove this load of sin;
        Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt,
        Set my conscience free from guilt.

        4. Lord, I come to Thee for rest,
        Take possession of my breast;
        There Thy blood-bought right maintain
        And without a rival reign.

        5. As the image in the glass
        Answers the beholder's face,
        Thus unto my heart appear;
        Print Thine own resemblance there.

        6. While I am a pilgrim here,
        Let Thy love my spirit cheer;
        As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
        Lead me to my journey's end.

        7. Show me what I have to do;
        Every hour my strength renew.
        Let me live a life of faith;
        Let me die Thy people's death.

        1. Behold the sure Foundation-stone
        1. Behold the sure Foundation-stone
        Which God in Zion lays
        To build our heavenly hopes upon
        And His eternal praise.

        2. Chosen of God, to sinners dear,
        Let saints adore the name;  
        They trust their whole salvation here,
        Nor shall they suffer shame.

        3. The foolish builders, scribe and priest,
        Reject it with disdain;
        Yet on this rock the Church shall rest
        And envy rage in vain.

        4. What though the gates of hell withstood
        Yet must this building rise.
        'Tis Thine own work, Almighty God,
        And wondrous in our eyes.

        1. Hark! The Church proclaims her honor,
        1. Hark! The Church proclaims her honor,
        And her strength is only this:
        God hath laid His choice upon her,
        And the work she doth is His.

        2. He His Church hath firmly founded,
        He will guard what He began;
        We, by sin and foes surrounded,
        Build her bulwarks as we can.

        3. Frail and fleeting are our powers,
        Short our days, our foresight dim,
        And we own the choice not ours,
        We were chosen first by Him.

        4. Onward, then! For naught despairing,
        Calm we follow at His word,
        Thus through joy and sorrow bearing
        Faithful witness to our Lord.

        5. Though we here must strive in weakness,
        Though in tears we often bend,
        What His might began in meekness
        Shall achieve a glorious end.


        1. I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
        1. I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
        The house of Thine abode,
        The Church our blest Redeemer saved
        With His own precious blood.

        2. I love Thy Church, O God,
        Her walls before Thee stand,
        Dear as the apple of Thine eye
        And graven on Thy hand.

        3. Should I with scoffers join
        Her altars to abuse?
        No! Better far my tongue were dumb,
        My hand its skill should lose.

        4. For her my tears shall fall,
        For her my prayers ascend,
        To her my cares and toils be given
        Till toils and cares shall end.

        5. Beyond my highest joy
        I prize her heavenly ways
        Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
        Her hymns of love and praise.

        6. Jesus, Thou Friend Divine,
        Our Savior and our King,
        Thy hand from every snare and foe
        Shall great deliverance bring.

        7. Sure as Thy truth shall last,
        To Zion shall be given
        The brightest glories earth can yield
        And brighter bliss of heaven.

        1. For all the saints who from their labors rest,
        1. For all the saints who from their labors rest,
        Who Thee by faith before the world confess,
        Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest,
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        2. Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might;
        Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
        Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        3. Oh, may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
        Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old
        And win with them the victor's crown of gold.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        4. O blest communion, fellowship divine,
        We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
        Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        5. And when the fight is fierce, the warfare long,
        Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
        And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        6. But, lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day;
        The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
        The King of Glory passes on His way.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        7. From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
        Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
        Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        8. The golden evening brightens in the west;
        Soon, soon, to faithful warriors cometh rest.
        Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.
        Alleluia! Alleluia!

        1. Blest be the tie that binds
        1. Blest be the tie that binds
        Our hearts in Christian love;
        The fellowship of kindred minds
        Is like to that above.

        2. Before our Father's throne
        We pour our ardent prayers;
        Our fears, our hopes, our alms, are one,
        Our comforts and our cares.

        3. We share our mutual woes,
        Our mutual burdens bear,
        And often for each other flows
        The sympathizing tear.

        4. When here our pathways part,
        We suffer bitter pain;
        Yet, one in Christ and one in heart,
        We hope to meet again.

        5. This glorious hope revives
        Our courage by the way,
        While each in expectation lives
        And longs to see the day.

        6. From sorrow, toil, and pain,
        And sin we shall be free
        And perfect love and friendship reign
        Through all eternity.
        1. Christ is our Corner-stone,
        1. Christ is our Corner-stone,
        On Him alone we build;
        With His true saints alone
        The courts of heaven are filled.
        On His great love
        Our hopes we place
        Of present grace
        And joys above.

        2. Oh, then, with hymns of praise
        These hallowed courts shall ring;
        Our voices we will raise
        The three in One to sing
        And thus proclaim
        In joyful song,
        Both loud and long.
        That glorious name.

        3. Here, gracious God, do Thou
        Forevermore draw nigh;
        Accept each faithful vow
        And mark each suppliant sigh.
        In copious shower
        On all who pray
        Each holy day,
        Thy blessing pour.

        4. Here may we gain from heaven
        The grace which we implore,
        And may that grace, once given,
        Be with us evermore
        Until that day
        When all the blest
        To endless rest
        Are called away!

        1. Christ, Thou art the sure Foundation,
        1. Christ, Thou art the sure Foundation,
        Thou the Head and Corner-stone;
        Chosen of the Lord and precious
        Binding all the Church in one;       
        Thou Thy Zion's Help forever
        And her Confidence alone.

        2. To this temple, where we call Thee,
        Come, O Lord of hosts, today;
        With Thy wonted loving-kindness
        Hear Thy servants as they pray
        And Thy fullest benediction
        Shed within these walls alway.

        3. Here voucesafe to all Thy servants
        What they ask of Thee to gain,
        What they gain from Thee forever
        With the blessed to retain,
        And hereafter in Thy glory,
        Evermore with Thee to reign.

        4. Praise and honor to the Father,
        Praise and honor to the Son,
        Praise and honor to the Spirit,
        Ever Three and ever One,
        One in might and one in glory,
        While unending ages run.

        1. Built on the Rock the Church doth stand,
        1. Built on the Rock the Church doth stand,
        Even when steeples are falling;
        Crumbled have spires in every land,
        Bells still are chiming and calling,
        Calling the young and old to rest,
        But above all the soul distrest,
        Longing for rest everlasting.

        2. Surely in temples made with hands,
        God, the Most High, is not dwelling;
        High above earth His temple stands,
        All earthly temples excelling.
        Yet He whom heavens cannot contain
        Chose to abide on earth with men,
        Built in our bodies His temple.

        3. We are God's house of living stones,
        Builded for His habitation;
        He through baptismal grace us owns
        Heirs of His wondrous salvation.
        Were we but two His name to tell,
        Yet He would deign with us to dwell,
        With all His grace and His favor.

        4. Now we may gather with our King
        E'en in the lowliest dwelling;
        Praises to Him we there may bring,
        His wondrous mercy forthtelling.
        Jesus His grace to us accords;
        Spirit and life are all His words;
        His truth doth hallow the temple.

        5. Still we our earthly temples rear
        That we may herald His praises;
        They are the homes where He draws near
        And little children embraces.
        Beautiful things in them are said;
        God there with us His covenant made,
        Making us heirs of His kingdom.

        6. Here stands the font before our eyes
        Telling how God did receive us;
        The altar recalls Christ's sacrifice
        And what His table doth give us;
        Here sounds the Word that doth proclaim
        Christ yesterday, today, the same,
        Yea, and for aye our Redeemer.

        7. Grant then, O God, where'er men roam,
        That, when the church-bells are ringing,
        Many in saving faith may come
        Where Christ His message is bringing:
        "I know Mine own, Mine own know Me;
        Ye, not the world, My face shall see.
        My peace I leave with you." Amen.

	1. For all Thy saints, O Lord,
	1. For all Thy saints, O Lord,
	Who strove in Thee to live,
	Who followed Thee, obeyed, adored,
	Our grateful hymn receive.
	
	2. For all Thy saints, O Lord,
	Who strove in Thee to die,
	Who counted Thee their great Reward,
	Accept our thankful cry.
	
	3.They all in life and death,
	With Thee, their Lord, in view,
	Learned from Thy Holy Spirit's breath
	To suffer and to do.
	
	4. For this Thy name we bless
	And humbly pray that we
	May follow them in holiness
	And live and die in Thee.

	1. Glorious things of thee are spoken,
	1. Glorious things of thee are spoken,
	Zion, city of our God;
	He whose word cannot be broken
	Formed thee for His own abode.
	On the Rock of Ages founded,
	What can shake thy sure repose?
	With salvation's walls surrounded
	Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.
	
	2. See, the streams of living waters
	Springing from eternal love
	Well supply thy sons and daughters
	And all fear of want remove.
	Who can faint while such a river
	Ever flows their thirst t'assuage--
	Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
	Never fails from age to age?
	
	3. Round each habitation hovering,
	See the cloud and fire appear,
	For a glory and a covering,
	Showing that the Lord is near.
	Thus they march, the pillar leading,
	Light by night and shade by day,
	Daily on the manna feeding
	Which He gives them when they pray.
	
	4. Savior, since of Zion's city
	I through grace a member am,
	Let the world deride or pity,
	I will glory in Thy name.
	Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
	All his boasted pomp and show;
	Solid joys and lasting treasure
	None but Zion's children know.

	1. Hark! The sound of holy voices
	1. Hark! The sound of holy voices
	Chanting at the crystal sea,
	Alleluia, Alleluia,
	Alleluia, Lord, to Thee.
	Multitudes which none can number
	Like the stars in glory stand,
	Clothed in white apparel, holding
	Palms of victory in their hand.
	
	2. Patriarch and holy prophet,
	Who prepared the way of Christ,
	King, apostle, saint, confessor,
	Martyr, and evangelist,
	Saintly maiden, godly matron,
	Widows who have watched to prayer,
	Joined in holy concert, singing
	To the Lord of all, are there.
	
	3. They have come from tribulation
	And have washed their robes in blood,
	Washed them in the blood of Jesus;
	Tried they were, and firm they stood.
	Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,
	Sawn asunder, slain with sword,
	They have conquered death and Satan
	By the might of Christ the Lord.
	
	4. Marching with Thy cross, their banner,
	They have triumphed, following
	Thee, the Captain of salvation,
	Thee, their Savior and their King.
	Gladly, Lord, with Thee they died, 
	And by death to life immortal
	They were born and glorified.
	
	5. Now they reign in heavenly glory,
	Now they walk in golden light,
	Now they drink, as from a river,
	Holy bliss and infinite.
	Love and peace they taste forever
	And all truth and knowledge see
	Of the blessed Trinity.
	
	6. God of God, the One-begotten,
	Light of Light, Emmanuel,
	In whose body, joined together,
	All the saints forever dwell,
	Pour upon us of Thy fulness
	That we may forevermore
	God the Father, God the Spirit.
	One with Thee on high, adore.

	1. Rise, ye children of salvation,
	1. Rise, ye children of salvation,
	All who cleave to Christ, the Head.
	Wake, arise, O mighty nation,
	Ere the Foe on Zion tread.
	He draws nigh and would defy
	All the hosts of God Most High.
	
	2. Saints and heroes long before us
	Firmly o this ground have stood;
	See their banner waving o'er us,
	Conquerors through the Savior's blood.
	Ground we hold whereon of old
	Fought the faithful and the bold.
	
	3. Fighting, we shall be victorious
	By the blood of Christ, our Lord;
	On our foreheads, bright and glorious,
	Shines the witness of His Word;
	Spear and shield on battle-field,
	His great name we cannot yield.
	
	4. When His servants stand before Him,
	Each receiving his reward;
	When His saints in light adore Him,
	Giving glory to the Lord,
	"Victory!" our songs shall be 
	Like the thunder of the sea.

	1. The Church's one foundation
	1. The Church's one foundation
	Is Jesus Christ, her Lord;
	She is His new creation
	By water and the Word.
	From heaven He came and sought her
	To be His holy bride;
	With His won blood He bought her,
	And for her life He died.
	
	2. Elect from every nation,
	Yet one o'er all the earth,
	Her charter of salvation
	One Lord, one faith, one birth.
	One holy name she blesses,
	Partakes one holy food,
	And to one hope she presses,
	With every grace endued.
	
	3. The Church shall never perish!
	Her dear Lord, to defend,
	To guide, sustain, and cherish,
	Is with her to the end.
	Though there be those that hate her.
	False sons within her pale,
	Against both foe and traitor
	She ever shall prevail.
	
	4. Though with a scornful wonder
	Men see her sore oppressed,
	By schisms rent asunder,
	By heresies distressed,
	Yet saints their watch are keeping;
	Their cry goes up, "How long?"
	And soon the night of weeping
	Shall be the morn of song.
	
	5. Mid toil and tribulation
	And tumult of her war
	She waits the consummation
	Of peace forevermore,
	Til with the vision glorious
	Her longing eyes are blest
	And the great Church victorious
	Shall be the Church at rest.

	1. Zion stands by hills surrounded,
	1. Zion stands by hills surrounded,
	Zion, kept by power divine;
	All her foes shall be confounded
	Though the world in arms combine.
	Happy Zion,
	What a favored lot is thine!
	
	2. Every human tie may perish,
	Friend to friend unfaithful prove,
	Mothers cease their own to cherish,
	Heaven and earth at last remove;
	But no changes
	Can attend Jehovah's love.
	
	3. In the furnace God may prove thee,
	Thence to bring thee forth more bright,
	But can never cease to love thee;
	Thou art precious in His sight.
	God is with thee,
	God, thine everlasting Light.

	1. Ye watchers and ye holy ones,
	1. Ye watchers and ye holy ones,
	Bright seraphs, cherubim, and thrones,
	Raise the glad strain, Alleluia!
	Cry out, dominions, princedoms, powers,
	Virtues, archangels, angels choirs,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!
	
	2. O higher than the cherubim,
	More glorious than the seraphim,
	Lead their praises, Alleluia!
	Thou Bearer of the eternal Word,
	Most gracious, magnify the Lord,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!
	
	3.Respond, ye souls in endless rest,
	Ye patriarchs and prophets blest,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!
	Ye holy Twelve, ye martyrs strong,
	All saints triumphant, raise the song,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!
	
	4. O friend, in gladness let us sing,
	Supernal anthems echoing,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!
	To God the Father, God the Son,
	And God the Spirit, Three in One,
	Alleluia! Alleluia!

	1. Ten thousand times ten thousand,
	1. Ten thousand times ten thousand,
	In sparkling raiment bright,
	The armies of the ransomed saints
	Throng up the steeps of light.
	'Tis finished, all is finished,
	Their fight with death and sin;
	Fling open wide the golden gates
	And let the victors in.
	
	2. What rush of alleluias
	Fills all the earth and sky!
	What ringing of a thousand harps
	Proclaims the triumph nigh!
	O day, for which creation
	And all its tribes were made;
	O joy, for all its former woes
	A thousandfold repaid!
	
	3. Oh, then what raptured greetings
	On Canaan's happy shore;
	What knitting severed friendships up
	Where partings are no more!
	Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
	That brimmed with tears of late;
	Orphans no longer fatherless
	Nor widows desolate.
	
	4. Bring near Thy great salvation,
	Thou Lamb for sinners slain;
	Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
	Then take Thy power and reign.
	Appear, Desire of Nations;
	Thine exiles long for home.
	Show in the heavens Thy promised sign;
	Thou Prince and Savior, come!

	1. Lord Jesus, Thou the Church's Head,
	1. Lord Jesus, Thou the Church's Head,
	Thou art her one Foundation;
	In Thee she trusts, before Thee bows,
	And waits for Thy salvation.
	Built on this Rock secure,
	Thy Church shall endure
	E'en though the world decay
	And all things pass away.
	Oh, hear, oh, hear us, Jesus!
	
	2. O Lord, let this Thy little flock,
	Thy name alone confessing,
	Continue in Thy loving care,
	True unity possessing.
	Thy Sacraments, O Lord,
	And Thy saving Word
	To us e'er pure retain.
	Grant that they may remain
	Our only strength and comfort.
	
	3. Help us to serve Thee evermore
	With hearts both pure and lowly;
	And my Thy Word, that light divine,
	Shine on in splendor holy
	That we repentance show,
	In faith ever grow;
	The power of sin destroy
	And all that doth annoy.
	Oh, make us faithful Christians!
	
	4. And for Thy Gospel let us dare
	To sacrifice all treasure;
	Teach us to bear Thy blessed cross,
	To find in Thee all pleasure.
	Oh, grant us steadfastness
	In joy and distress,
	That we Thee ne'er forsake.
	Let us by grace partake
	O endless joy and glory.
	
	1. The saints on earth and those above
	1. The saints on earth and those above
	But one communion make;
	Joined to their Lord in bonds of love,
	All of His grace partake.
	
	2. One family, we dwell in Him,
	One Church above, beneath;
	Though now divided by the stream,
	The narrow stream, of death.
	
	3. One army of the living God,
	To His commands we bow;
	Part of the host have passed the flood,
	And part are crossing now.
	
	4. Lo, thousands to their endless home
	Are swiftly borne away;
	And we are to the margin come
	And soon must launch as they.
	
	5. Lord Jesus, be our constant Guide;
	Then, when the word is given,
	Bid death's cold flood its waves divide
	And land us safe in heaven.

	1. Lord of the worlds above,
	1. Lord of the worlds above,
	How pleasant and how fair
	The dwellings of Thy love,
	Thine earthly temples are!
	To Thine abode
	My heart aspires
	With warm desires
	To see my God.
	
	2. The sparrow, for her young,
	With pleasure seeks her nest,
	And wandering swallows long
	To find their wonted rest.
	My spirit faints
	With equal zeal
	To rise and dwell
	Among Thy saints.
	
	3. Oh, happy souls who pray
	Where God appoints to hear!
	Oh, happy men who pay
	Their constant service there!
	They praise Thee still;
	And happy they
	Who love the way
	To Zion's hill.
	
	4. They go from strength to strength
	Through this dark vale of tears
	Till each arrives at length,
	Till each in heaven appears,
	Oh, glorious seat
	When God, our King,
	Shall thither bring
	Our willing feet!

	1. Through the night of doubt and sorrow
	1. Through the night of doubt and sorrow
	Onward goes the pilgrim band,
	Singing songs of expectation,
	Marching to the Promised Land.
	Clear before us, through the darkness,
	Gleams and burns the guiding light.
	Brother clasps the hand of brother,
	Stepping fearless through the night.
	
	2. One the light of God's own presence,
	O'er His ransomed people shed,
	Chasing far the gloom and terror,
	Brightening all the path we tread;
	One the object of our journey,
	One the faith which never tires.
	One the earnest looking forward,
	One the hope our God inspires.
	
	3. One the strain the lips of thousands
	Lift as from the heart of one;
	One the conflict, one the peril,
	One their march in God begun;
	One the gladness of rejoicing
	On the far eternal shore,
	Where the one almighty Father
	Reigns in love forevermore.
	
	4. Onward, therefore, pilgrim brothers!
	Onward, with the cross our aid!
	Bear its shame and fight its battle
	Till we rest beneath its shade.
	Soon shall come the great awaking,
	Soon the rending of the tomb,
	Then the scattering of all shadows,
	And the end of toil and gloom.

	1. God of the prophets, bless the prophet's sons;
	1. God of the prophets, bless the prophet's sons;
	Elijah's mantle o'er Elisha cast.
	Each age its solemn task may claim by once;
	Make each one nobler, stronger, than the last.
	
	2. Annoint them prophets. Make their ears attent
	To Thy divinest speech, their hearts awake
	To human need, their lips make eloquent
	To gird the right and every evil break.
	
	3. Annoint them priests. Strong intercessors, they,
	For pardon and for charity and peace.
	Ah, if with them the world might, now astray,
	Find in our Lord from all its woes release!
	
	4. Annoint them kings; aye, kingly kings, O Lord.
	Annoint them with the Spirit of Thy Son.
	Theirs not a jeweled crown, a blood-stained sword;
	Theirs, by sweet love, for Christ a kingdom won.
	
	5. Make them apostles, heralds of Thy Cross;
	Forth may they go to tell all realms Thy grace.
	Inspired of Thee, may they count all but loss
	And stand at last with joy before Thy face.

	1. We bid thee welcome in the name
	1. We bid thee welcome in the name
	Of Jesus, our exalted Head.
	Come as a servant,--so He came,--
	And we receive thee in His stead.
	
	2. Come as a shepherd; guard and keep
	This fold from hell and world and sin;
	Nourish the lambs and feed the sheep;
	The wounded heal, the lost bring in.
	
	3. Come as a teacher sent from God,
	Charged His whole counsel to declare.
	Lift o'er our ranks the prophet's rod
	While we uphold thy hands with prayer.
	
	4. Come as a messenger of peace,
	Filled with the Spirit, fired with love.
	Live to behold our large increase
	And die to meet us all above.

	1. Lord Jesus, who art come
	1. Lord Jesus, who art come
	A Teacher sent from heaven
	And by both word and deed
	God's truth to us hast given,
	Thou wisely hast ordained
	The holy ministry
	That we, Thy flock, may know
	The way to God through thee.
	
	2. Thou hast, O Lord, returned,
	To God's right hand ascending;
	Yet Thou art in the world,
	Thy kingdom here extending.
	Through preaching of Thy Word
	In every land and clime
	Thy people's faith is kept
	Until the end of time.
	
	3. O blessed ministry
	Of reconciliation,
	That shows the way to God
	And brings to us salvation!
	By Thine evangel pure,
	Lord, Thou preserv'st Thy fold,
	Doest call, enlighten, keep,
	Dost comfort and uphold.
	
	4. Preserve this ministry 
	While harvest-days are keeping;
	And since the fields are white
	And hands are few for reaping,
	Send workers forth, O Lord,
	The sheaves to gather in
	That not a soul be lost
	Which Thou art come to win.
	
	5. The servants Thou hast called
	And to Thy Church art giving
	Preserve in doctrine pure
	And holiness of living.
	Thy Spirit fill their hearts,
	Endue their tongues with power;
	What they should boldly speak,
	Oh, give them in that hour!
	
	6. Yea, bless Thy Word alway,
	Our souls forever feeding;
	And may we never lack
	A faithful shepherd's leading!
	Seek Thou the wandering sheep,
	Bind up the sore opprest,
	Lift up the fallen ones,
	And grant the weary rest.
	
	7. Bring those into Thy fold
	Who still to Thee are strangers;
	Guard those who are within 
	Against offense and dangers.
	Press onward with Thy Word
	Till pastor and his fold
	Through faith in Thee, O Christ,
	Thy glory shall behold.

	1. O Thou whose feet have climbed life's hill
	1. O Thou whose feet have climbed life's hill
	And trod the path of youth,
	Our Savior and our Brother still,
	Now lead us into truth.
	
	2. The call is Thine; be Thou the Way,
	And give us men, to guide.
	Let wisdom broaden with the day;
	Let human faith abide.
	
	3. Who learn of Thee the truth shall find;
	Who follow, gain the goal.
	With reverence crown the earnest mind
	And speak within the soul.
	
	4. Awake the purpose high which strives
	And, falling, stands again;
	Conform the will of eager lives
	To quit themselves like men.
	
	5. Thy life the bond of fellowship,
	Thy love the law that rules,
	Thy name, proclaimed by every lip,
	The Master of our schools.

	1. How beauteous are at their feet
	1. How beauteous are at their feet
	Who stand on Zion's hill;
	Who bring salvation on their tongues 
	And words of peace reveal!
	
	2. How charming is their voice!
	How sweet their tidings are!
	"Zion, behold thy Savior-King;
	He reigns and triumphs here."
	
	3. How happy are the ears
	That hear this joyful sound
	Which kings and prophets waited for
	And sought, but never found!
	
	4.How blessed are the eyes 
	That see this heavenly light!
	Prophets and kings desired it long,
	But died without the sight.
	
	5. The watchmen join their voice
	And tuneful notes employ;
	Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
	And deserts learn the joy.
	
	6. The Lord makes bare His arm
	Through all the earth abroad.
	Let every nation now behold
	Their Savior and their God.

	1. Lord of the harvest, hear
	1. Lord of the harvest, hear
	Thy needy servants cry;
	Answer our faith's effectual prayer
	And all our wants supply.
	
	2. On Thee we humbly wait,
	Our wants are in Thy view.
	The harvest, truly, Lord, is great,
	The laborers are few.
	
	3. Anoint and send forth more
	Into Thy Church abroad
	And let them speak Thy Word of Power
	As workers with their God.
	
	4. Oh, let them spread Thy name,
	Their mission fully prove,
	Thy universal grace proclaim,
	Thine all-redeeming love!

	1. Lord of the Church, we humbly pray
	1. Lord of the Church, we humbly pray
	For those who guide us in Thy way
	And speak Thy holy Word.
	With love divine their hearts inspire.
	And touch their lips with hallowed fire
	And needful strength afford.
	
	2. Help them to preach the Truth of God,
	Redemption through the Savior's blood,
	Nor let the Spirit cease
	On all the Church His gifts to shower--
	To them a messenger of power;
	To us, of life and peace.
	
	3. So may they live to Thee alone,
	Then hear the welcome word, "Well done,"
	And take their crown above;
	Enter into their Master's joy
	And all eternity employ
	In praise and bliss and love.

        1. Pour out Thy Spirit from on high,
        1. Pour out Thy Spirit from on high,
        Lord, Thine assembled servants bless;
        Graces and gifts to each supply
        And clothe Thy priests with righteousness.

        2. Before Thine altar when we stand
        To teach the truth as taught by Thee,
        Savior, like stars in Thy right hand
        The angels of Thy churches be.

        3. Wisdom and zeal and faith impart,
        Firmness with meekness, from above,
        To bear Thy people on our heart
        And love the souls whom Thou dost love;

        4. To watch and pray and never faint
        By day and night strict guard to keep,
        To warn the sinner, cheer the saint,
        Nourish Thy lambs, and feed Thy sheep.

        5. Then, when our work is finished here,
        We may in hope our charge resign.
        When the Chief Shepherd shall appear,
        O God, may they and we be Thine! 

        1. Send, O Lord, Thy Holy Spirit
        1. Send, O Lord, Thy Holy Spirit
        On Thy servant now, we pray;
        Let him prove a faithful shepherd
        To Thy little lambs alway.
        Thy pure teaching to proclaim,
        To extol Thy holy name,
        And to feed Thy lambs, dear Savior,
        Make his aim and sole endeavor.

        2. Thou, O Lord, Thyself hast called him
        For Thy precious lambs to care;
        But to prosper in his calling,
        He the Spirit's gifts must share.
        Grant him wisdom from above,
        Fill his heart with holy love;
        In all weakness be Thou near him,
        In his prayers, Good Shepherd, hear him.

        3. Help, Lord Jesus, help him nourish
        Our dear children with Thy Word
        That in constant love they serve Thee
        Till in heav'n their song is heard.
        Boundless blessings, Lord, bestow
        On his faithful toil below
        Till by grace to him is given
        His reward, the crown of heaven.
        
        1. Lord of the living harvest
        1. Lord of the living harvest
        That whitens o'er the plain,
        Where angels soon shall gather
        Their sheaves of golden grain,
        Accept these hands to labor,
        These hearts to trust and love,
        And deign with them to hasten
        Thy kingdom from above.

        2. As lab'rers in Thy vineyard,
        Lord, send them out to be
        Content to bear the burden
        Of weary days for Thee.
        To ask no other wages
        When Thou shalt call them home
        Then to have shared the travail
        Which makes Thy kingdom come.

        3. Be with them, God the Father;
        Be with them, God the Son;
        And God the Holy Spirit,
        Most blessed Three in One.
        Make them Thy faithful servants
        Thee rightly to adore
        And fill them with Thy fulness
        Both now and evermore.

        1. Thou who the night in prayer didst spend
        1. Thou who the night in prayer didst spend
        And then didst Thine apostles send
        And bidd'st us pray the harvest's Lord
        To send forth sowers of Thy Word,
        Hear and Thy chosen servants bless
        With sev'nfold gifts of holiness.

        2. Oh, may Thy pastors faithful be,
        Not lab'ring for themselves, but Thee!
        Give grace to feed with wholesome food
        The sheep and lambs bought by Thy blood,
        To tend Thy flock, and thus to prove
        How dearly they the Shepherd love.

        3. Oh, may Thy people faithful be
        And in Thy pastors honor Thee
        And with them work and for them pray
        And gladly Thee in them obey,
        Receive the prophet of the Lord
        And gain the prophet's own reward!

        4. So may we when our work is done
        Together stand before Thy throne
        And joyful hearts and voices raise
        In one united song of praise,
        With all the bright celestial host,
        To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

        1. Awake, Thou Spirit, who didst fire
        1. Awake, Thou Spirit, who didst fire
        The watchmen of the Church's youth,
        Who faced the Foe's envenomed ire,
        Who witnessed day and night Thy truth,
        Whose voices loud are ringing still
        And bringing hosts to know Thy will.

        2. Lord, let our earnest prayer be heard,
        The prayer Thy Son hath bid us pray;
        For, lo, Thy children's hearts are stirred
        In ev'ry land in this our day
        To cry with fervent soul to Thee,
        Oh, help us, Lord! So let it be!

        3. Oh, haste to help ere we are lost!
        Send preachers forth, in spirit strong,
        Armed with Thy Word, a dauntless host,
        Bold to attach the rule of wrong;
        Let them the earth for Thee reclaim,
        Thy heritage, to know Thy name.

        4. And let Thy Word have speedy course,
        Thro ev'ry land be glorified,
        Till all the heathen know its force
        And fill Thy churches far and wide.
        Oh, spread the conquest of Thy Word
        And let Thy kingdom come, dear Lord!

        1. From Greenland's icy mountains,
        1. From Greenland's icy mountains,
        From India's coral strand,
        Where Afric's sunny fountains
        Roll down their golden sand;
        From many an ancient river,
        From many a palmy plain,
        They call us to deliver
        Their land from error's chain.

        2. What though the spicy breezes
        Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;
        Though ev'ry prospect pleases
        And only man is vile;
        In vain with lavish kindness
        The gifts of God are strown;
        The heathen in his blindness
        Bows down to wood and stone.

        3. Can we whose souls are lighted
        With wisdom from on high,
        Can we to men benighted
        The lamp of life deny?
        Salvation! Oh, Salvation!
        The joyful sound proclaim
        Till each remotest nation
        Has learned Messiah's name.

        4. Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
        And you, ye waters, roll,
        Till like a sea of glory
        It spreads from pole to pole;
        Till o'er our ransomed nature
        The lamb for sinners slain,
        Redeemer, King, Creator,
        In bliss returns to reign.

        1. Hark! the voice of Jesus crying,
        1. Hark! the voice of Jesus crying,
        "Who will go and work today?
        Fields are white and harvests waiting,
        Who will bear the sheave away?"
        Loud and long the Master calleth,
        Rich reward He offers thee;
        Who will answer, gladly saying,
        "Here am I, send me, send me"?

        2. If you cannot speak like angels,
        If you cannot preach like Paul,
        You can tell the love of Jesus,
        You can say He died for all.
        If you cannot rouse the wicked
        With the Judgement's dread alarms,
        You can lead the little children
        To the Savior's waiting arms.

        3 If you cannot be a watchman,
        Standing high on Zion's wall,
        Pointing out the path to heaven,
        Offering life and peace to all,
        With your prayers and with your bounties
        You can do what God demands;
        You can be like faithful Aaron,
        Holding up the prophet's hands.

        4. Let none hear you idly saying,
        "There is nothing I can do,"
        While the souls of men are dying
        And the Master calls for you.
        Take the task He gives you gladly,
        Let His work your pleasure be;
        Answer quickly when He calleth,
        "Here am I, send me, send me!"

        1. The morning light is breaking,
        1. The morning light is breaking,
        The darkness disappears;
        The sons of earth are waking
        To penitential tears.
        Each breeze that sweeps the ocean
        Brings tidings from afar
        Of nations in commotion,
        Prepared for Zion's war.

        2. See heathen nations bending
        Before the God we love,
        And thousand hearts ascending
        In gratitude above,
        While sinners, now confessing,
        The Gospel-call obey
        And seek the Savior's blessing,
        A nation in a day.

        3. Blest river of salvation,
        Pursue thine onward way;
        Flow thou to ev'ry nation
        Nor in thy richness stay;
        Stay not till all the lowly
        Triumphant reach their home;
        Stay not till all the holy
        Proclaim, "The Lord is come."


        1. Rise, Thou Light of Gentile nations,
        1. Rise, Thou Light of Gentile nations,
        Jesus, bright and Morning Star;
        Let Thy Word, the gladsome tidings,
        Ring out loudly near and far,
        Bringing freedom to the captives,
        Peace and comfort to the slave,
        That the heathen, free from bondage,
        May proclaim Thy pow'r to save.

        2. See the blindness of the heathen,
        Strangers to Thy glorious light,
        Straying hopeless till they find Thee,
        Wand'ring aimless in the night.
        See their pitiful condition;
        Lo, gross darkness covers all,
        And no ray of hope refreshes
        Nor dispels the dreadful pall.

        3. If Thou, merciful Redeemer,
        Hadst not saved us from this plight,
        In like darkness we should languish
        Hopeless, helpless, in sin's night.
        Lovingly Thou, Lord, didst seek us
        In the beauty of Thy grace;
        Now with joy we freely serve Thee,
        We, Thy blessed, chosen race.

        4. Knowing Thee and Thy salvation,
        Grateful love dare never cease
        To proclaim Thy tender mercies,
        Gracious Lord, Thy heav'nly peace.
        Sound we forth the Gospel tidings
        To the earth's remotest bound
        That the sinner has been pardoned
        And forgiveness can be found.

        5. May our zeal to help the heathen
        Be increased from day to day
        As we plead in true compassion
        And for their conversion pray.
        For the many faithful heralds,
        For the Gospel they proclaim,
        Let us all be cheerful givers
        To the glory of Thy name.

        6. Savior, shine in all Thy glory
        On the nations near and far;
        From the highways and the byways
        Call them, O Thou Morning Star.
        Guide them whom Thy grace hath chosen
        Out of Satan's dreadful thrall
        To the mansions of Thy Father--
        There is room for sinners all.

        1. Look from Thy sphere of endless day,
        1. Look from Thy sphere of endless day,
        O God of mercy and of might!
        In pity look on those who stray
        Benighted in this land of light.

        2. In peopled vale, in lonely glen,
        In crowded mart, by stream or sea,
        How many of the sons of men
        Hear not the message sent from Thee!

        3. Send forth Thy heralds, Lord, to call
        The thoughtless young, the hardened old,
        A scattered, homeless flock, till all
        Be gathered to Thy peaceful fold.

        4. Send them Thy mighty Word to speak
        Till faith shall dawn and doubt depart,
        To awe the bold, to stay the weak,
        And bind and heal the broken heart.

        5. Then all these wastes, a dreary scene
        That makes us sadden as we gaze,
        Shall grow with living waters green
        And lift to heaven the voice of praise.
        
        1. May God bestow on us His grace,
        1. May God bestow on us His grace,
        With blessings rich provide us,
        And may the brightness of His face
        To life eternal guide us
        That we His saving health may know,
        His gracious will and pleasure,
        And also to the heathen show
        Christ's riches without measure
        And unto God convert them.

        2. Thine over all shall be the praise
        And thanks of every nation,
        And all the world with joy shall raise
        The voice of exultation;
        For Thou shalt judge the earth, O Lord,
        Nor suffer sin to flourish;
        Thy people's pasture is Thy Word
        Their souls to feed and nourish,
        In righteous paths to keep them.

        3. Oh, let the people praise Thy worth,
        In all good works increasing;
        The land shall plenteous fruit bring forth,
        Thy Word is rich in blessing.
        May God the Father, God the Son,
        And God the Spirit bless us!
        Let all theworld praise Him alone,
        Let solemn awe possess us.

        1. Soldiers of the Cross, arise,
        1. Soldiers of the Cross, arise,
        Gird you with your armor bright.
        Mighty are your enemies,
        Hard the battle ye must fight.

        2. O'er a faithless, fallen world
        Raise your banner in the sky;
        Let it float there wide unfurled;
        Bear it onward, lift it high.

        3. Mid the homes of want and woe,
        Strangers to the living Word,
        Let the Savior's heralds go,
        Let the voice of hope be heard.

        4. Where the shadows deepest lie,
        Carry truth's unsullied ray;
        Where are crimes of blackest dye,
        There the saving sign display.

        5. To the weary and the worn
        Tell of realms where sorrows cease;
        To the outcast and forlorn
        Speak of mercy and of peace.

        6. Guard the helpless, seek the strayed,
        Comfort troubles, banish grief;
        In the might of God arrayed,
        Scatter sin and unbelief.

        7. Be the banner still unfurled,
        Still unsheathed the Spirit's Sword;
        Spread Thy Word in all the world;
        Let Thy kingdom come, O Lord.

        1. Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning,
        1. Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning,
        Token of our coming Lord;
        O'er the earth the field is whit'ning;
        Louder rings the Master's word:
        Pray for reapers, Pray for reapers,
        In the harvest of the Lord!

        2. Now, O Lord, fulfil Thy pleasure,
        Breathe upon Thy chosen band,
        And with Pentecostal measure
        Send forth reapers o'er our land,
        Faithful reapers, Faithful reapers,
        Gath'ring sheaves for Thy right hand.

        3. Soon shall end the time of weeping,
        Soon the reaping time will come,
        Heav'n and earth together keeping
        God's eternal Harvest-home.
        Saints and angels, saints and angels,
        Shout the world's great Harvest-home.

        1. Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise!
        1. Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise!
        Exalt thy tow'ring head and lift thine eyes;
        See heav'n its sparkling portals wide display
        And break upon thee in a flood of day.

        2. See a long race thy spacious courts adorn;
        See future sons and daughters, yet unborn,
        In crowding ranks on ev'ry side arise
        Demanding life, impatient for the skies.

        3. See barb'rous nations at thy gates attend,
        Walk in the light, and in thy temple bend;
        See thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings,
        While ev'ry land its joyful tribute brings.

        4. The seas shall waste, the skies in smoke decay,
        Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away;
        But fixed this Word, this saving pow'r, remains;
        Thy realms shall last, thine own Messiah reigns.

        1. O Spirit of the living God,
        1. O Spirit of the living God,
        In all Thy plentitude of grace,
        Where'er the foot of man hath trod,
        Descend on our apostate race.

        2. Give tongues of fire and hearts of love
        To preach the reconciling Word;
        Give pow'r and unction from above
        Where'er the joyful sound is heard.

        3. Be darkness, at Thy coming, light;
        Confusion, order, in Thy path;
        Souls without strength inspire with might;
        Bid mercy triumph over wrath.

        4. O Spirit of the Lord, prepare
        A sinful world their God to meet;
        Breathe Thou abroad like morning air
        Till hearts of stone begin to beat.

        5. Baptize the nations; far and nigh
        The triumphs of the Cross record;
        The name of Jesus glorify
        Till every kindred call Him Lord.

        6. God from eternity hath willed
        All flesh shall His salvation see;
        So be the Father's love fulfilled,
        The Savior's sufferings crowned through Thee.

        1. O'er the gloomy hills of darkness,
        1. O'er the gloomy hills of darkness,
        Cheered by no celestial ray,
        Sun of Righteousness, arising,
        Bring the bright, the glorious day.
        Let the morning
        Of Thy blessed Gospel dawn.

        2. Kingdoms wide that sit in darkness,
        Grant them, Lord, the glorious light;
        And from eastern coast to western
        May the morning chase the night
        And redemption,
        Freely purchased, win the day!

        3. Fly abroad, eternal Gospel;
        Win and conquer, never cease.
        May Thy lasting, wide dominions
        Multiply and still increase!
        May Thy scepter
        Sway th'enlightened world around!

        1. Send Thou, O Lord, to every place
        1. Send Thou, O Lord, to every place
        Swift messengers before Thy face,
        The heralds of Thy wondrous grace,
        Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

        2. Send men whose eyes have seen the King,
        Men in whose ears His sweet words ring;
        Send such Thy lost ones home to bring;
        Send them where Thou wilt come,--

        3. To bring good news to souls in sin,
        The bruised and broken hearts to win;
        In ev'ry place to bring them in
        Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

        4. Thou who hast died, Thy vict'ry claim;
        Assert, O Christ, Thy glory's name
        And far to lands of pagan shame
        Send men where Thou wilt come.

        5. Gird each one with the Spirit's Sword,
        The sword of Thine own deathless Word,
        And make them conquerors, conquering Lord,
        Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

        6. Raise up, O Lord the Holy Ghost,
        From this broad land a mighty host;
        Their war cry, "We will seek the lost
        Where Thou, O Christ, wilt come."

        1. Spread, oh, spread, thou mighty Word,
        1. Spread, oh, spread, thou mighty Word,
        Spread the kingdom of the Lord,
        Wheresoe'er His breath has giv'n
        Life to beings meant for heav'n.

        2. Tell them how the Father's will
        Made the world and keeps it still,
        How His only Son He gave
        Man from sin and death to save.

        3. Tell of our Redeemer's love,
        Who forever doth remove
        By His holy sacrifice
        All the guilt that on us lies.

        4. Tell them of the Spirit giv'n
        Now to guide us up to heav'n,
        Strong and holy, just and true,
        Working both to will and do.

        5. Up! The ripening fields ye see.
        Mighty shall the harvest be;
        But the reapers still are few,
        Great the work they have to do.

        6. Lord of Harvest, let there be
        Joy and strength to work for Thee
        Till the nations far and near
        See Thy light and learn Thy fear.

        1. Thou whose almighty word
        1. Thou whose almighty word
        Chaos and darkness heard
        And took their flight,
        Hear us, we humbly pray,
        And where the Gospel day
        Sheds not its glorious ray,
        Let there be light!

        2. Thou who didst come to bring,
        On Thy redeeming wing,
        Healing and sight,
        Health to the sick in mind,
        Sight to the inly blind,
        Oh, now to all mankind
        Let there be light!

        3. Spirit of Truth and Love,
        Lifegiving, holy Dove,
        Speed forth Thy flight;
        Move on the water's face,
        Bearing the lamp of grace,
        And in earth's darkest place
        Let there be light!

        4. Holy and blessed Three,
        Glorious Trinity,
        Wisdom, Love, Might!
        Boundless as ocean's tide,
        Rolling in fullest pride,
        Thro the earth, far and wide,
        Let there be light!

        1. Savior, sprinkle many nations,
        1. Savior, sprinkle many nations,
        Fruitful let Thy sorrows be;
        By Thy pains and consolations
        Draw the Gentiles unto Thee.
        Of Thy Cross the wondrous story,
        Be it to the nations told;
        Let them see Thee in Thy glory
        And Thy mercy manifold.

        2. Let to mortals all be given
        Thee to know and life to gain,
        Thee, the very God of heaven,
        Thee, the Man for sinners slain.
        Speak Thou hope to ev'ry mortal
        Thro the Gospel, sweet and blest;
        Lead them thro Thy kingdom's portal
        To eternal peace and rest.

        3. Great the need in ev'ry nation,
        Dense the darkness of sin's night;
        Let Thy Spirit bring salvation,
        Love's pure flame, and wisdom's light.
        Give the Word, Thy preachers strengthen
        With the prophets pow'r of old,
        Help them Zion's cords to lengthen,
        All Thy wand'ring sheep to fold.

        1. Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
        1. Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
        Does his successive journeys run,
        His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
        Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

        2. For Him shall endless prayer be made,
        And endless praises crown His head;
        His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise
        With ev'ry morning sacrifice.

        3. People and realms of ev'ry tongue
        Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
        And infant voices shall proclaim
        Their early blessings on His name.

        4. Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
        The pris'ner leaps, unloosed his chains,
        The weary find eternal rest,
        And all the sons of want are blest.

        5. Where He displays His healing power,
        Death and the curse are known no more;
        In Him the tribes of Adam boast
        More blessings than their father lost.

        6. Let every creature rise and bring
        Peculiar honors to our King;
        Angels descend with songs again,
        And earth repeat the loud Amen.

        1. O Christ, our true and only Light,
        1. O Christ, our true and only Light,
        Enlighten those who sit in night;
        Let those afar now hear Thy voice
        And in Thy fold with us rejoice.

        2. Fill with the radiance of Thy grace
        The souls now lost in error's maze
        And all whom in their secret minds
        Some dark delusion haunts and blinds.

        3. Oh, gently call those gone astray
        That they may find the saving way!
        Let every conscience sore opprest
        In Thee find peace and heavenly rest.

        4. Oh, make the deaf to hear Thy Word
        And teach the dumb to speak, dear Lord,
        Who dare not yet the faith avow,
        Though secretly they hold it now.

        5. Shine on the darkened and the cold,
        Recall the wanderers to Thy fold,
        Unite all those who walk apart,
        Confirm the weak and doubting heart,

        6. So they with us may evermore
        Such grace with wondering thanks adore
        And endless praise to Thee be given
        By all Thy Church in earth and heaven.

	1. Art thou weary, art thou troubled,
	1. Art thou weary, art thou troubled,
	Art thou sore distressed?
	"Come to Me," saith One, "and, coming,
	Be at rest."
	
	2. Hath He marks to lead me to Him
	If He be my Guide?
	"In His feet and hands are wound-prints,
	And His side."
	
	3. Hath He diadem, as Monarch,
	That His brow adorns?
	"Yea, a crown, in very surety,
	But of thorns."
	
	4. If I find Him, if I follow,
	What His guerdon here?
	"Many a sorrow, many a labor,
	Many a tear."
	
	5. If I still hold closely to Him,
	What hath He at last?
	"Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,
	Jordan passed."
	
	6. If I ask Him to receive me,
	Will He say me nay?
	"Not till earth and not till heaven
	Pass away."
	
	7. Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
	Is He sure to bless?
	"Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,
	Answer, Yes."

	1. God moves in a mysterious way
	1. God moves in a mysterious way
	His wonders to perform;
	He plants His footsteps in the sea
	And rides upon the storm.
	
	2. Deep in unfathomable mines
	Of never-failing skill
	He treasures up His bright designs
	And works His sovereign will.
	
	3. Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
	The clouds ye so much dread
	Are big with mercy and shall break
	In blessings on your head.
	
	4. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.
	But trust Him for His grace;
	Behind a frowning providence
	He hides a smiling face.
	
	5. His purposes will ripen fast,
	Unfolding every hour;
	The bud may have a bitter taste,
	But sweet will be the flower.
	
	6. Blind unbelief is sure to err
	And scan His work in vain;
	God is His own Interpreter,
	And He will make it plain.

	1. 0 Thou from whom all goodness flows,
	1. 0 Thou from whom all goodness flows,
	I lift my heart to Thee;
	In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
	Dear Lord, remember me.
	
	2. When on my poor and burdened heart
	My sins lie heavily,
	Thy pardon speak, new peace impart;
	Dear Lord, remember me.
	
	3. When trials sore obstruct my way
	And ills I cannot flee,
	Oh, let my strength be as my day;
	Lord, remember me.
	
	4. If worn with pain, disease, or grief
	This feeble body be:
	Grant patience, rest, and kind relief;
	Dear Lord, remember me.
	
	5. When in the solemn hour of death
	I wait Thy just decree,
	Be this the prayer of my last breath:
	Dear Lord, remember me.
	
	6. And when before Thy throne I stand
	And lift my soul to Thee,
	Then with the saints at Thy right hand,
	Dear Lord, remember me.

	1. In the hour of trial,
	1. In the hour of trial,
	Jesus, plead for me
	Lest by base denial
	I depart from Thee.
	When Thou see'st me waver,
	With a look recall
	Nor for fear or favor
	Suffer me to fall.
	
	2. With forbidden pleasures
	Should this vain world charm
	Or its tempting treasures
	Spread to work me harm,
	Bring to my remembrance
	Sad Gethsemane
	Or, in darker semblance,
	Cross-crowned Calvary.
	
	3. Should Thy mercy send me
	Sorrow, toil, and woe,
	Or should pain attend me
	On my path below,
	Grant that I may ever
	Cast my care on Thee.
	
	4. When my last hour cometh.
	Fraught with strife and pain,
	When my dust returneth
	To the dust again,
	On Thy truth relying,
	Through that mortal strife,
	Jesus, take me, dying,
	To eternal life.

	1. The will of God is always best
	1. The will of God is always best
	And shall be done forever;
	And they who trust in Him are blest,
	He will forsake them never.
	He helps indeed In time of need,
	He chastens with forbearing;
	They who depend On God, their Friend,
	Shall not be left despairing.
	
	2. God is my Comfort and my Trust,
	My Hope and life abiding;
	And to His counsel wise and just,
	I yield in Him confiding.
	The very hairs, His Word declares,
	Upon my head He numbers.
	By night and day God is my Stay,
	He never sleeps nor slumbers.
	
	3. Lord Jesus, this I ask of Thee,
	Deny me not this favor:
	When Satan sorely troubles me,
	Then do not let me waver.
	Keep watch and ward, O gracious Lord,
	Fulfil Thy faithful saying:
	Who doth believe He shall receive
	An answer to His praying.
	
	4. When life's brief course on earth is run
	And I this world am leaving,
	Grant me to say: "Thy will be done."
	By faith to Thee still cleaving.
	My heavenly Friend, I now commend
	My soul into Thy keeping,
	O'er sin and hell, And death as well,
	Through Thee the victory reaping.

	1. If thou but suffer God to guide thee
	1. If thou but suffer God to guide thee
	And hope in Him through all thy ways,
	He'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee,
	And bear thee through the evil days.
	Who trusts in God's unchanging love
	Builds on the Rock that naught can move.
	
	2. What can these anxious cares avail thee,
	These never-ceasing moans and sighs?
	What can it help if thou bewail thee
	O'er each dark moment as it flies?
	Our cross and trials do but press
	The heavier for our bitterness.
	
	3. Be patient and await His leisure
	In cheerful hope, with heart content
	To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure
	And His discerning love hath sent,
	Nor doubt our inmost wants are known
	To Him who chose us for His own.
	
	4. God knows full well when times of gladness
	Shall be the needful thing for thee.
	When He has tried thy soul with sadness
	And from all guile has found thee free,
	He comes to thee all unaware
	And makes thee own His loving care.
	
	5. Nor think amid the fiery trial
	That God hath cast thee off unheard,
	That he whose hopes meet no denial
	Must surely be of God preferred.
	Time passes and much change doth bring
	And sets a bound to everything.
	
	6. All are alike before the Highest;
	'Tis easy to our God, we know,
	To raise thee up, though low thou liest,
	To make the rich man poor and low.
	True wonders still by Him are wrought
	Who setteth up and brings to naught.
	
	7. Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,
	Perform thy duties faithfully,
	And trust His Word, though undeserving,
	Thou yet shalt find it true for thee.
	God never yet forsook in need
	The soul that trusted Him indeed.

	1. Beloved, "It is well!"
	1. Beloved, "It is well!"
	God's ways are always right,
	And perfect love is o'er them all
	Though far above our sight.

	2. Beloved, "It is well!"
	Though deep and sore the smart,
	The hand that woudnds knows how to bind
	And heal the broken heart.

	3. Beloved, "It is well!"
	Though sorrow clouds our way,
	'Twill only make the joy more dear
	That ushers in the day.

	4. Beloved, "It is well!"
	The path that Jesus trod,
	Though rough and strait and dark it be,
	Leads home to heaven and God.
        1. Commit whatever grieves thee
        1. Commit whatever grieves thee
        Into the gracious hands
        Of Him who never leaves thee,
        Who heaven and earth commands.
        Who points the clouds their courses,
        Whom winds and waves obey,
        He will direct thy footsteps
        And find for thee a way.

        2. On Him place thy reliance
        If thou wouldst be secure;
        His work thou must consider
        If thine is to endure.
        By anxious sighs and grieving
        And self-tormenting care
        God is not moved to giving;
        All must be gained by prayer.

        3. Thy truth and grace, O Father,
        Most surely see and know
        Both what is good and evil
        For mortal man below.
        According to Thy counsel
        Thou wilt Thy work pursue;
        And what Thy wisdom chooseth
        Thy might will always do.

        4. Thy hand is never shortened,
        All things must serve Thy might;
        Thine every act is blessing,
        Thy path is purest light.
        Thy work no man can hinder,
        Thy purpose none can stay,
        Since Thou to bless Thy children
        Wilt always find a way.

        5. Though all the powers of evil
        The will of God oppose,
        His purpose will not falter,
        His pleasure onward goes.
        Whate'er God's will resolveth,
        Whatever He intends.
        Will always be accomplished
        True to His aims and ends.

        6. Then hope, my feeble spirit,
        And be thou undismayed;
        God helps in every trial
        And makes thee unafraid.
        Await His time with patience,
        Then shall thine eyes behold
        The sun of joy and gladness
        His brightest beams unfold.

        7. Arise, my soul, and banish
        Thy anguish and thy care.
        Away with thoughts that sadden
        And heart and mind ensnare!
        Thou art not lord and master
        Of thine own destiny;
        Enthroned in highest heaven,
        God rules in equity.

        8. Leave all to His direction;
        In wisdom He doth reign,
        And in a way most wondrous
        His course He will maintain.
        Soon He, His promise keeping,
        With wonder-working skill,
        Shall put away the sorrows
        That now thy spirit fill.

        9. A while His consolation
        He may to thee deny,
        And seem as though in trial
        He far from thee would fly;
        A while distress and anguish
        May compass thee around,
        Nor to thy supplication
        An answering voice be found.

        10. But if thou perseverest,
        Thou shalt deliverance find.
        Behold, all unexpected
        He will thy soul unbind
        And from the heavy burden
        Thy heart will soon set free;
        And thou wilt see the blessing
        He had in mind for thee.

        11. O faithful child of heaven,
        11. O faithful child of heaven,
        How blessed shalt thou be!
        With songs of glad thanksgiving
        A crown awaiteth thee.
        Into thy hand thy Maker
        Will give the victor's palm.
        And thou to thy Deliverer
        Shalt sing a joyous psalm.

        12. Give, Lord, this consummation
        To all our heart's distress;
        Our hands, our feet, e'er strengthen,
        In death our spirits bless.
        Thy truth and Thy protection
        Grant evermore, we pray,
        And in celestial glory
        Shall end our destined way.

	1. What God ordains is always good;
	1. What God ordains is always good;
	His will abideth holy.
	As He directs my life for me,
	I follow meek and lowly.
	God indeed in every need
	Doth well know how to shield me;
	To Him, then, I will yield me.
	
	2. What God ordains is always good. 
	He never will deceive me;
	He leads me in His own right way,
	And never will He leave me.
	I take content What He hath sent;
	His hand that sends me sadness
	Will turn my tears to gladness.
	
	3. What God ordains is always good.
	His loving thought attends me;
	No poison can be in the cup
	That my Physician sends me.
	My God is true; Each morn anew
	I'll trust His grace unending,
	My life to Him commending.
	
	4. What God ordains is always good. 
	He is my Friend and Father;
	He suffers naught to do me harm,
	Though many storms may gather.
	Now I may know Both joy and woe,
	Some day I shall see clearly
	That He hath loved me dearly.
	
	5. What God ordains is always good. 
	Though I the cup am drinking
	Which savors now of bitterness,
	I take it without shrinking.
	For after grief God grants relief,
	My heart with comfort filling
	And all my sorrow stilling.
	
	6. What God ordains is always good. 
	This truth remains unshaken.
	Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
	I shall not be forsaken.
	I fear no harm, For with His arm
	He shall embrace and shield me;
	So to my God I yield me.

        1. When in the hour of utmost need
        1. When in the hour of utmost need
        We know not where to look for aid;
        When days and nights of anxious thought
        Nor help nor counsel yet have brought,

        2. Then this our comfort is alone,
        That we may meet before Thy throne
        And cry, O faithful God, to Thee
        For rescue from our misery;

        3. To Thee may raise our hearts and eyes,
        Repenting sore with bitter sighs,
        And seek Thy pardon for our sin
        And respite from our griefs within.

        4. For Thou hast promised graciously
        To hear all those who cry to Thee
        Through Him whose name alone is great,
        Our Savior and our Advocate.

        5. And thus we come, O God, today
        And all our woes before Thee lay;
        For sorely tried, cast down, we stand,
        Perplexed by fears on every hand.

        6. Ah! hide not for our sins Thy face,
        Absolve us through Thy boundless grace,
        Be with us in our anguish still,
        Free us at last from every ill,

        7. That so with all our hearts we may
        To Thee our glad thanksgiving pay,
        Then walk obedient to Thy Word
        And now and ever praise Thee, Lord.

	1. Why should cross and trial grieve me?
	1. Why should cross and trial grieve me?
	Christ is near With His cheer;
	Never will He leave me.
	Who can rob me of the heaven
	That God's Son For my own
	To my faith hath given?

	2. Though a heavy cross I'm bearing
	And my heart Feels the smart,
	Shall I be despairing?
	God, my Helper, who doth send it,
	Well doth know All my woe
	And how best to end it.

	3. God oft gives me days of gladness;
	Shall I grieve If He give
	Seasons, too, of sadness?
	God is good and tempers ever
	All my ill, And He will
	Wholly leave me never.

	4. Hopeful, cheerful, and undaunted
	Everywhere They appear
	Who in Christ are planted.
	Death itself cannot appal them,
	They rejoice When the voice
	Of their Lord doth call them.

	5. Death cannot destroy forever;
	From our fears, Cares, and tears
	It will us deliver.
	It will close life's mournful story,
	Make a way That we may
	Enter heavenly glory.

	6. What is all this life possesses?
	But a hand Full of sand
	That the heart distresses.
	Noble gifts that pall me never
	Christ, our Lord, Will accord
	To His saints forever.

	7. Lord, my Shepherd, take me to Thee.
	Thou art mine; I was Thine,
	Even e'er I knew Thee.
	I am Thine, for Thou hast bought me;
	Lost I stood, But Thy blood
	Free salvation brought me.

	8. Thou art mine; I love and own Thee.
	Light of Joy, Ne'er shall I
	From my heart dethrone Thee.
	Savior, let me soon behold Thee
	Face to face, -May Thy grace
	Evermore enfold me!

	1. In Thee, Lord, have I put my trust;
	1. In Thee, Lord, have I put my trust;
	Leave me not helpless in the dust,
	Let me not be confounded.
	Let in Thy Word My faith, 0 Lord,
	Be always firmly grounded.
	
	2. Bow down Thy gracious ear to me
	And hear my cries and prayers to Thee,
	Haste Thee for my protection;
	For woes and fear Surround me here.
	Help me in mine affliction.
	
	3. My God and Shield, now let Thy power
	Be unto me a mighty tower
	Whence bravely I defend me
	Against the foes That round me close.
	0 Lord, assistance lend me.
	
	4. Thou art my Strength, my Shield, my Rock,
	My Fortress that withstands each shock,
	My Help, my Life, my Treasure.
	Whate'er the rod, Thou art my God;
	Naught can resist Thy pleasure.
	
	5. The world for me has falsely set
	Full many a secret snare and net
	To tempt me and to harm me.
	Lord, make them fail, Do Thou prevail,
	Let their disguise not charm me.
	
	6. With Thee, Lord, have I cast my lot;
	0 faithful God, forsake me not,
	To Thee my soul commending.
	Lord, be my Stay, Lead Thou the way
	Now and when life is ending.
	
	7. All honor, praise, and majesty
	To Father, Son, and Spirit be,
	Our God forever glorious,
	In whose rich grace We'll run our race
	Till we depart victorious.

	1. As pants the hart for cooling streams
	1. As pants the hart for cooling streams
	When heated in the chase,
	So longs my soul, O God, for Thee
	And Thy refreshing grace.
	
	2. For Thee, my God, the living God,
	My thirsty soul doth pine;
	Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
	Thou Majesty Divine?
	
	3. Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
	Hope still; and thou shalt sing
	The praise of Him who is thy God,
	Thy health's eternal Spring.
	
	4. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
	The God whom we adore,
	Be glory as it was, is now,
	And shall be evermore.

	1. In God, my faithful God,
	1. In God, my faithful God,
	I trust when dark my road;
	Though many woes o'ertake me,
	Yet He will not forsake me.
	His love it is doth send them
	And, when 'tis best, will end them.

	2. My sins assail me sore,
	But I despair no more.
	I build on Christ, who loves me;
	From this Rock nothing moves me.
	To Him I all surrender,
	To Him, my soul's Defender.
	
	3. If death my portion be,
	Then death is gain to me
	And Christ my Life forever,
	From whom death cannot sever.
	Come when it may, He'll shield me,
	To Him I wholly yield me.
	
	4. 0 Jesus Christ, my Lord,
	So meek in deed and word,
	Thou once didst die to save us
	Because Thy love would have us
	Be heirs of heavenly gladness
	When ends this life of sadness.
	
	5. "So be it," then, I say
	With all my heart each day.
	We, too, dear Lord, adore Thee.
	We sing for joy before Thee.
	Guide us while here we wander
	Until we praise Thee yonder.

	1. Lord, it belongs not to my care
	1. Lord, it belongs not to my care
	Whether I die or live;
	To love and serve Thee is my share,
	And this Thy grace must give.
	
	2. If life be long, I will be glad
	That I may long obey;
	If short no laborer is sad
	To end his toilsome day.
	
	3. Christ leads me through no darker rooms
	Than He went through before;
	He that into God's kingdom comes
	Must enter by this door.
	
	4. Come, Lord, when grace has made me meet
	Thy blessed face to see;
	For if Thy work on earth be sweet.
	What will Thy glory be?
	
	5. Then shall I end my sad complaints
	And weary, sinful days
	And join with the triumphant saints
	That sing my Savior's praise.
	
	6. My knowledge of that life is small,
	The eye of faith is dim;
	But 'tis enough that Christ knows all,
	And I shall be with Him.

        1. If God Himself be for me,
        1. If God Himself be for me,
        I may a host defy;
        For when I pray, before me
        My foes, confounded, fly.
        If Christ, my Head and Master,
        Befriend me from above,
        What foe or what disaster
        Can drive me from His love?

        2. This I believe, yea, rather,
        Of this I make my boast,
        That God is my dear Father,
        The Friend who loves me most,
        And that, whate'er betide me,
        My Savior is at hand
        Through stormy seas to guide me
        And bring me safe to land.

        3. I build on this foundation,
        That Jesus and His blood
        Alone are my salvation,
        The true, eternal good.
        Without Him all that pleases
        Is valueless on earth;
        The gifts I owe to Jesus
        Alone my love are worth.

        4. My Jesus is my Splendor,
        My Sun, my Light, alone;
        Were He not my Defender
        Before God's awe-full throne,
        I never should find favor
        And mercy in His sight,
        But be destroyed forever
        As darkness by the light.

        5. He canceled my offenses,
        Delivered me from death;
        He is the Lord who cleanses
        My soul from sin through faith.
        In Him I can be cheerful,
        Bold, and undaunted aye;
        In Him I am not fearful
        Of God's great Judgment Day.

        6. Naught, naught, can now condemn me
        Nor set my hope aside;
        Now hell no more can claim me,
        Its fury I deride.
        No sentence e'er reproves me,
        No ill destroys my peace;
        For Christ, my Savior, loves me
        And shields me with His grace.

        7. His Spirit in me dwelleth,
        And o'er my mind He reigns.
        All sorrow He dispelleth
        And soothes away all pains.
        He crowns His work with blessing
        And helpeth me to cry,
        "My Father!" without ceasing,
        To Him who dwells on high.

        8. And when my soul is lying
        Weak, trembling, and opprest,
        He pleads with groans and sighing
        That cannot be exprest;
        But God's quick eye discerns them,
        Although they give no sound,
        And into language turns them
        E'en in the heart's deep ground.

        9. To mine His Spirit speaketh
        Sweet word of holy cheer,
        How God to him that seeketh
        For rest is always near
        And how He hath erected
        A city fair and new,
        Where what our faith expected
        We evermore shall view.

        10. In yonder home doth flourish
        My heritage, my lot;
        Though here I die and perish,
        My heaven shall fail me not.
        Though care my life oft saddens
        And causeth tears to flow,
        The light of Jesus gladdens
        And sweetens every woe.

        11. Who clings with resolution
        11. Who clings with resolution
        To Him whom Satan hates
        Must look for persecution;
        For him the burden waits
        Of mockery, shame, and losses,
        Heaped on his blameless head;
        A thousand plagues and crosses
        Will be his daily bread.

        12. From me this is not hidden,
        Yet I am not afraid;
        I leave my cares, as bidden,
        To whom my vows were paid.
        Though life and limb it cost me
        And everything I won,
        Unshaken shall I trust Thee
        And cleave to Thee alone.

        13. Though earth be rent asunder,
        Thou'rt mine eternally;
        Not fire nor sword nor thunder
        Shall sever me from Thee;
        Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,
        Not pain nor poverty
        Nor mighty princes anger
        Shall ever hinder me.

        14. No angel and no gladness,
        No throne, no pomp, no show,
        No love, no hate, no sadness,
        No pain, no depth of woe,
        No scheme of man's contrivance,
        However small or great,
        Shall draw me from Thy guidance
        Nor from Thee separate.

        15. My heart for joy is springing
        And can no more be sad,
        'Tis full of mirth and singing,
        Sees naught but sunshine glad.
        The Sun that cheers my spirit
        Is Jesus Christ, my King;
        That which I shall inherit
        Makes me rejoice and sing.

        1. I leave all things to God's direction,
        1. I leave all things to God's direction,
        He loveth me in weal and woe;
        His will is good, true His affection.
        With tender love His heart doth glow.
        My Fortress and my Rock is He:
        What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

        2. My God hath all things in His keeping,
        He is the ever faithful Friend;
        He grants me laughter after weeping,
        And all His ways in blessings end.
        His love endures eternally:
        What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

        3. The will of God shall be my pleasure
        While here on earth is mine abode;
        My will is wrong beyond all measure,
        It doth not will what pleaseth God.
        The Christian's motto e'er must be:
        What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

        4. God knows what must be done to save me,
        His love for me will never cease;
        Upon His hands He did engrave me
        With purest gold of loving grace.
        His will supreme must ever be!
        What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

        5. My God desires the soul's salvation,
        Me also He desires to save;
        Therefore with Christian resignation
        All earthly troubles I will brave.
        His will be done eternally:
        What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

	1. Thy ways, 0 Lord, with wise design
	1. Thy ways, 0 Lord, with wise design
	Are framed upon Thy throne above,
	And every dark and bending line
	Meets in the center of Thy love.
	
	2. With feeble light and half obscure
	Poor mortals Thine arrangements view,
	Not knowing that the least are sure
	And the mysterious just and true.
	
	3. Thy flock, Thine own peculiar care,
	Though now they seem to roam uneyed,
	Are led or driven only where
	They best and safest may abide.
	
	4. They neither know nor trace the way;
	But whilst they trust Thy guardian eye,
	Their feet shall ne'er to ruin stray,
	Nor shall the weakest fail or die.
	
	5. My favored soul shall meekly learn
	To lay her reason at Thy throne;
	Too weak Thy secrets to discern,
	I'll trust Thee for my Guide alone.

	1. Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish,
	1. Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish,
	Come to the Mercy-seat, fervently kneel.
	Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
	Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.
	
	2. Joy of the desolate, Light of the straying,
	Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;
	Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
	Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot cure.
	
	3. Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing
	Forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
	Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
	Earth has no sorrow but Heaven can remove.

	1. Thy way, not mine, 0 Lord,
	1. Thy way, not mine, 0 Lord,
	However dark it be.
	Lead me by Thine own hand;
	Choose Thou the path for me.
	I dare not choose my lot;
	I would not if I might.
	Choose Thou for me, my God;
	So shall I walk aright.
	
	2. Choose Thou for me my friends,
	My sickness or my health;
	Choose Thou my cares for me,
	My poverty or wealth.
	Not mine, not mine, the choice,
	In things or great or small;
	Be Thou my Guide, my Strength,
	My Wisdom, and my All.

	1. Nearer, my God to Thee, 
	1. Nearer, my God to Thee, 
	Nearer to Thee.
	E'en though it be a cross
	That raiseth me,
	Still all my song shall be.
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer to Thee.

	2. Though like the wanderer, 
	The sun gone down, 
	Darkness be over me,
	My rest a stone, 
	Yet in my dreams I'd be
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer to Thee. 
	
	3. There let my way appear
	Steps unto heaven;
	All that Thou sendest me
	In mercy given;
	Angels to beckon me
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer to Thee. 
	
	4. Then with my waking thoughts
	Bright with Thy praise,
	Out of my stony griefs
	Bethel I'll raise,
	So by my woes to be
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer to Thee. 
	
	5. Or if on joyful wing,
	Cleaving the sky,
	Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
	Upward I fly,
	Still all my song shall be,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,
	Nearer to Thee. 

	1. God of my life, to Thee I call;
	1. God of my life, to Thee I call;
	Afflicted, at Thy feet I fall;
	When the great water-floods prevail,
	Leave not my trembling heart to fall.

	2. Friend of the friendless and the faint,
	Where should I lodge my deep complaint?
	Where but with Thee, whose open door
	Invites the helpless and the poor?

	3. Did ever mourner plead with Thee
	And Thou refuse that moumer's plea?
	Does not the word still fixed remain
	That none shall seek Thy face in vain?

	4. Fair is the lot that's cast for me;
	I have an Advocate with Thee.
	They whom the world caresses most
	Have no such privilege to boast.
	
	5. Poor though I be, despised, forgot,
	Yet God, my God, forgets me not;
	And he is safe and must succeed
	For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.
	
	6. Then hear, 0 Lord, my humble cry
	And bend on me Thy pitying eye.
	To Thee their prayer Thy people make:
	Hear us for our Redeemer's sake.

        1. Rejoice, my heart, be glad and sing,
        1. Rejoice, my heart, be glad and sing,
        A cheerful trust maintain;
        For God, the Source of everything,
        Thy Portion shall remain.

        2. He is thy Treasure, He thy Joy,
        Thy Life and Light and Lord,
        Thy Counselor when doubts annoy,
        Thy Shield and great Reward.

        3. Why spend the day in blank despair,
        In restless thought the night?
        On thy Creator cast thy care;
        He makes thy burdens light.

        4. Did not His love and truth and power
        Watch o'er thy childhood day?
        Has He not oft in threatening hour
        Turned dreaded ills away?

        5. He ever will with patience chide,
        His rod falls gently down,
        And all thy sins He casts aside
        And in the sea doth drown.

        6. When silent woe thy bosom rends,
        His pity sees thy grief,
        Supplies what to His glory tends
        And to thine own relief.

        7. He knows how oft a Christian weeps
        And why his tears now fall;
        And in the His mercy keeps
        These things are noted all.

        8. His wisdom never plans in vain,
        Ne'er falters or mistakes;
        All that His counsels did ordain
        A happy ending makes.

        9. Upon thy lips, then, lay thy hand
        And trust His guiding love;
        Then like a rock thy peace shall stand
        Here and in heaven above.

        1. Awake, my soul, and with the sun
        1. Awake, my soul, and with the sun
        Thy daily stage of duty run;
        Shake off dull sloth and joyful rise
        To pay thy morning scarifice.

        2. Let all thy converse be sincere,
        Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
        Think how the all-seeing God thy ways
        And all thy secret thought surveys.

        3. All praise to Thee, who safe hast kept
        And hast refreshed me whilst I slept.
        Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,
        I may of endless light partake.

        4. Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;
        Disperse my sins as morning dew;
        Guard my first springs of thought and will
        And will Thyself my spirit fill.

        5. Direct, control, suggest, this day
        All I design or do or say
        That all my powers, with all their might,
        In Thy sole glory may unite.

        6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
        Praise Him, all creatures here below;
        Praise Him above, ye heavenly host:
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

        1. Every morning mercies new
        1. Every morning mercies new
        Fall as fresh as morning dew;
        Every morning let us pay
        Tribute with the early day;
        For Thy mercies, Lord, are sure,
        Thy compassion doth endure.

        2. Still the greatness of Thy love
        Daily doth our sins remove;
        Daily, far as east from west,
        Lifts the burden from the breast;
        Gives unbought to those who pray
        Strength to stand in evil day.

        3. Let our prayers each morn prevail
        That these gifts may never fail;
        And as we confess the sin
        And the Tempter's power within,
        Feed us with the Bread of Life;
        Fit us for our daily strife.

        4. As the morning light returns,
        As the sun with splendor burns,
        Teach us still to turn to Thee,
        Ever-blessed Trinity.
        With our hands our hearts to raise
        In unfailing prayer and praise.

        1. Now the shades of night are gone,
        1. Now the shades of night are gone,
        Now the morning light is come.
        Lord, may we be Thine today;
        Drive the shades of sin away.

        2. Fill our souls with heavenly light,
        Banish doubt and cleanse our sight.
        In Thy service, Lord, today
        Help us labor, help us pray.

        3. Keep our haughty passions bound,
        Save us from our foes around;
        Going out and coming in,
        Keep us safe from every sin.

        4. When our work of life is past;
        Oh, receive us then at last!
        Night of sin will be no more
        When we reach the heavenly shore.

        1. Come, Thou Bright and Morning Star,
        1. Come, Thou Bright and Morning Star,
        Light of light, without beginning!
        Shine upon us from afar
        That we may be kept from sinning.
        Drive away by Thy clear light
        Our dark night.

        2. Let Thy grace, like morning dew
        Falling soft on barren places,
        Comfort, quicken, and renew
        Our dry souls and dying graces;
        Bless Thy flock from Thy rich store
        Evermore.

        3. May Thy fervent love destroy
        Our cold works, in us awaking
        Ardent zeal and holy joy
        At the purple morn's first breaking.
        Let us truly rise ere yet
        Life has set.

        4. Ah! thou Dayspring from on high,
        Grant that at Thy next appearing
        We who in the graves do lie
        May arise, Thy summons hearing,
        And rejoice in our new life,
        Far from strife.

        5. Light us to those heavenly spheres,
        Sun of grace, in glory shrouded;
        Lead us through this vale of tears
        To the land where days unclouded,
        Purest joy, and perfect peace
        Never cease.
        1. O blessed Holy Trinity,
        1. O blessed Holy Trinity,
        Divine, eternal Unity,
        God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
        Be Thou this day my Guide and Host.

        2. My soul and body keep from harm,
        O'er all I have extend Thine arm,
        That Satan may not cause distress
        Nor bring me shame and wretchedness.

        3. The Father's love shield me this day,
        The Son's pure wisdom cheer my way,
        The Holy Spirit's light divine
        Illume my heart's benighted shrine.

        4. My Maker, strengthen Thou my heart,
        O my Redeemer, help impart,
        Blest Comforter, keep at my side
        That faith and love in me abide.

        5. Lord, bless and keep Thou me as Thine;
        Lord, make Thy face upon me shine;
        Lord, lift Thy countenance on me
        And give me peace, sweet peace, from Thee.

        1. The sun arises now
        1. The sun arises now
        In light and glory
        And gilds the rugged brow
        Of mountains hoary,
        Be glad, my soul, and lift
        Thy voice in singing
        To God from earth below,
        Thy heart with joy aglow
        And praises ringing.

        2. Like countless grains of sand,
        Beyond all measure,
        And wide as sea and land
        Is Heaven's treasure
        Of grace which Christ, my Lord,
        Each day bestoweth,
        Which, like refreshing rain,
        Into my soul again
        Each morning floweth.

        3. Keep Thou my soul today
        From sin and blindness;
        Surround me on my way
        With loving-kindness
        And fill my heart, O God,
        With joy from heaven;
        I then shall ask no more
        Than what Thou hast of yore
        In wisdom given.

        4. Thou knowest best my needs,
        My sighs Thou heedest;
        Thy hand Thy children feeds,
        Thine own Thou leadest.
        What should I more desire,
        With Thee deciding
        The course that I must take,
        Than follow in the wake
        Where Thou art guiding?

        1. When, streaming from the eastern skies,
        1. When, streaming from the eastern skies,
        The morning light salutes my eyes,
        O Sun of Righteousness Divine,
        On me with beams of mercy shine;
        Chase the dark clouds of sin away
        And turn my darkness into day.

        2. When to heaven's great and glorious King
        My morning sacrifice I bring
        And, grieving o'er my guilt and shame,
        Ask mercy, Savior, in Thy name.
        My conscience sprinkle with Thy blood
        And be my Advocate with God.

        3. When each day's scenes and labors close
        And wearied nature seeks repose,
        With pardoning mercy, richly blest,
        Guard me, my Savior, while I rest;
        And as each morning's sun shall rise,
        Oh, lead me onward to the skies!

        4. And at my life's last setting sun,
        My conflict o'er, my labor done,
        Jesus, Thy heavenly radiance shed
        To cheer ands bless my dying bed
        And from death's gloom my spirit raise
        To see Thy face and sing Thy praise.

        1. While yet the morn is breaking,
        1. While yet the morn is breaking,
        I thank my God once more,
        Beneath whose care awaking,
        I find the night is o'er,
        I thank Him that He calls me
        To life and health anew;
        I know, whate'er befalls me,
        His care will still be true.

        2. O Israel's Guardian, hear me,
        Watch over me this day;
        In all I do be near me,
        For others, too, I pray;
        To Thee I would commend them,
        Our Church, our youth, our land,
        Direct them and defend them
        When dangers are at hand.

        3. O gracious Lord, direct us,
        Thy doctrine pure defend,
        From heresies protect us,
        And for Thy Word contend
        That we may praise Thee ever,
        O God, with one accord
        And say: The Lord, our Savior,
        Be evermore adored.

        4. Oh, grant us peace and gladness,
        Give us our daily bread,
        Shield us from grief and sadness,
        On us Thy blessings shed.
        Grant that our whole behavior,
        In truth and righteousness,
        May praise Thee, Lord, our Savior,
        Whose holy name we bless.

        5. And gently grant Thy blessing
        That we may do Thy will,
        No more Thy ways transgressing,
        Our proper task fulfil,
        With Peter's full assurance
        Let down our nets again,
        Success will crown endurance
        If faithful we remain.

        6. Thou art the Vine,--oh, nourish
        The branches graft in Thee
        And let them grow and flourish,
        A fair and fruitful tree.
        Thy Spirit pour within us
        And let His gifts of grace
        To such good actions win us
        As best may show Thy praise.

        1. How lovely shines the morning star!
        1. How lovely shines the morning star!
        In twilight sky it gleams afar;
        The reign of night is ended.
        Creation stirs to hail the light
        Whose glories now with radiance bright
        Stream forth in beauty splendid.
        Both far And near
        All things living Thanks are giving,
        Praise outpouring,
        Earth and sky the Lord adoring.

        2. Then haste, my soul, thy song to raise,
        Delay thou not thy Lord to praise,
        Bow down in adoration.
        For glory, Lord, to Thee belongs,
        Thy praise resounds in grateful songs,
        Thou Lord of all creation.
        Let all Recall
        Hymns of gladness Without sadness,
        For Thy favor
        And Thy mercy never waver.

        3. Though evil spirits through the night
        With hellish craft and watchful spite
        Came round me without number,
        Yet Thou, O Jesus, with Thy power
        Wast near me in that threatening hour,
        Didst guard me in my slumber.
        Praise be to Thee,
        My Contender And Defender,
        I'll adore Thee
        While on earth I walk before Thee.

        4. Pour down Thy grace in cheering streams
        And warm my heart with mercy's beams
        From heaven, Thy throne of beauty;
        Thy Spirit ever lead and guide
        That in my calling I abide
        And find my joy in duty.
        Send light And might
        That each measure, Plan and pleasure,
        Heavenward tending,
        E'er in Thee may find its ending.

        5. Keep grief, if this may be, away;
        If not, Thy will be done, I pray,
        My choice to Thine resigning.
        Then, O my heart, cast care aside,
        God through the cross His own hath tried;
        Bear loss without repining.
        Hope still Through ill;
        To God cleaving, Grace receiving,
        We shall wonder
        At God's goodness here and yonder.

        1. The radiant sun shines in the skies,
        1. The radiant sun shines in the skies,
        With joy from sleep we now arise.
        All praise to God, who through this night
        Hath kept us from the devil's might.

        2. Lord Jesus Christ, guide us this day;
        Keep sin and shame far from our way.
        Thy guardian angels to us send
        And let them to our wants attend.

        3. Direct our hearts to do Thy will
        And for Thy Word true love instil
        That we may do whate'er is right
        And ever pleasing in Thy sight.

        4. Crown all our labors with success,
        Each one in his own calling bless.
        May all we do or think or say
        Exalt and praise Thee, Lord, this day!

        1. My inmost heart now raises
        1. My inmost heart now raises
        In this fair morning hour
        A song of thankful praises
        To Thine almighty pow'r,
        O God, upon Thy throne.
        To honor and adore Thee,
        I bring my praise before Thee
        Thro Christ, Thine only Son.

        2. For Thou from me hast warded
        All perils of the night;
        From ev'ry harm hast guarded
        My soul till morning light.
        To Thee I humbly cry,
        O Savior, have compassion
        And pardon my transgression;
        Have mercy, Lord most high!

        3. And shield me from all evil,
        O gracious God, this day,
        From sin, and from the devil,
        From shame and from dismay,
        From fire's consuming breath,
        From water's devastation,
        From need and consternation,
        From evil sudden death.

        4. Let not Thine angel leave me
        While here on earth I stay
        Lest Satan's arts deceive me
        And lead my soul astray.
        Then keep Thine angel near
        At night and each new morrow
        Lest soul and body sorrow
        And falt'ring cost me dear.

        5. God shall do my advising,
        Whose might with wisdom blends;
        May He bless rest and rising,
        My efforts, means, and ends!
        To God, forever blest,
        Will I with mine confide me,
        And willing let Him guide me
        As seemeth to Him best.

        6. Amen I say, not fearing
        That God rejects my prayer;
        I doubt that He is hearing
        And granting me His care.
        Thus I go on my way
        And do not look behind me,
        But ply the task assigned me;
        God's help shall be my stay.

        1. God, who madest earth and heaven,
        1. God, who madest earth and heaven,
        Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
        Who the day and night hast given,
        Sun and moon and starry host;
        Whose almighty hand sustains
        Earth and all that it contains:

        2. God, I thank Thee, in Thy keeping
        Safely have I slumbered here;
        Thou hast guarded me while sleeping
        From all danger, pain, and fear;
        And the cunning evil Foe
        Hath not wrought my overthrow.

        3. Let the night of my transgression
        With night's darkness pass away.
        Jesus, into Thy possession
        I resign myself today;
        In Thy wounds I find relief
        From all sorrow, sin, and grief.

        4. Help me as the morn is breaking,
        In the spirit to arise,
        So from careless sloth awaking,
        That, when o'er the aged skies
        Shall the Judgment Day appear,
        I may see it without fear.

        5. Lead me, and forsake me never,
        Guide my wanderings by Thy Word;
        As Thou hast been, be Thou ever
        My Defense, my Refuge, Lord.
        Never safe except with Thee,
        Thou my faithful Guardian be.

        6. O my God, I now commend me
        Wholly to Thy mighty hand;
        As the powers that Thou dost lend me
        Let me use at Thy command.
        Lord, my Shield, my Strength divine,
        Keep me with Thee,--I am Thine.

        1. O splendor of God's glory bright,
        1. O splendor of God's glory bright,
        Who bringest forth the light from Light;
        O Light of light, light's Fountain-spring;
        O Day, our days enlightening:

        2. Come, very Sun of truth and love,
        Come in Thy radiance from above
        And shed the Holy Spirit's ray
        On all we think or do today.

        3. Likewise to Thee our prayers ascend,
        Father of glory without end,
        Father of saving grace, for pow'r
        To conquer in temptation's hour.

        4. Teach us to work with all our might;
        Beat back the devil's threatening spite;
        Turn all to good that seems most ill;
        Help us our calling to fulfil.

        5. Direct and govern heart and mind,
        With body chaste and disciplined;
        Let faith her eager fires renew
        And hate the false and love the true.

        6. On Christ, the true Bread, let us feed,
        Let Him to us be drink indeed,
        And let us taste with joyfulness
        The Holy Spirit's plenteousness.

        7. Oh, joyful be the livelong day,
        Our thoughts as pure as morning ray,
        Our faith like noonday's glowing height,
        Our souls undimmed by shades of night.

        8. The dawn begins to speed her way,
        Let the true Dawn himself display,
        The Son with God the Father One,
        And God the Father in the Son.

        9. All praise to God the Father be,
        All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
        Whom with the Spirit we adore
        Forever and forevermore.

	1. Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear,
	1. Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear,
	It is not night if Thou be near.
	Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise
	To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.

	2. When the soft dews of kindly sleep
	My wearied eyelids gently steep,
	Be my last thought how sweet to rest
	Forever on my Savior's breast.

	3. Abide with me from morn till eve,
	For without Thee I cannot live;
	Abide with me when night is nigh,
	For without Thee I dare not die.

	4. If some poor wandering child of Thine
	Has spurned today the voice divine,
	Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
	Let him no more lie down in sin.

	5. Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
	With blessings from Thy boundless store;
	Be every mourner's sleep tonight,
	Like infant's slumbers, pure and light.

	6. Come near and bless us when we wake,
	Ere through the world our way we take,
	Till in the ocean of Thy love
	We lose ourselves in heaven above.

        1. Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;
        1. Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;
        The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
        When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
        Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!

        2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
        Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
        Change and decay in all around I see.
        O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!

        3. Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
        But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
        Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
        Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.

        4. Come not in terror, as the King of kings,
        But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
        Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
        Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

        5. Thou on my head in every youth didst smile,
        And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
        Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
        On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

        6. I need Thy presence every passing hour;
        What but Thy grace can foil the Tempter's power?
        Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
        Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me!

        7. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
        Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness.
        Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
        I triumph still if Thou abide with me.

        8. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,
        Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies.
        Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
        In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

	1. Through the day Thy love hath spared us,
	1. Through the day Thy love hath spared us,
	Now we lay us down to rest;
	Through the silent watches guard us,
	Let no foe our peace molest.
	Jesus, Thou our Guardian be;
	Sweet it is to trust in Thee.

	2. Pilgrims here on earth and strangers,
	Dwelling in the midst of foes,
	Us and ours preserve from dangers;
	In Thine arms may we repose
	And, when life's sad day is past,
	Rest with Thee in heaven at last.

        1. Now rest beneath night's shadow
        1. Now rest beneath night's shadow
        The woodland, field, and meadow,
        The world in slumber lies;
        But Thou, my heart, awake thee,
        To prayer and song betake thee;
        Let praise to thy Creator rise.

        2. The radiant sun hath vanished,
        His golden rays are banished
        By night, the foe of day;
        But Christ, the Sun of gladness,
        Dispelling all my sadness,
        Within my heart holds constant sway.

        3. The rule of day is over
        And shining jewels cover
        The heaven's boundless blue.
        Thus I shall shine in heaven,
        Where crowns of gold are given
        To all who faithful prove and true.

        4. To rest my body hasteth,
        Aside its garments casteth,
        Types of mortality;
        These I put off and ponder
        How Christ will give me yonder
        A robe of glorious majesty.

        5. Lord Jesus, who dost love me,
        Oh, spread Thy wings above me
        And shield me from alarm!
        Though evil would assail me,
        Thy mercy will not fail me:
        I rest in Thy protecting arm.

        6. My loved ones, rest securely,
        For God this night will surely
        From peril guard your heads.
        Sweet slumbers may He send you
        And bid His hosts attend you
        And through the night watch o'er your beds.

	1. The day is past and over;
	1. The day is past and over;
	All thanks, O Lord, to Thee!
	I pray Thee now that sinless
	The hours of dark may be.
	O Jesus, keep me in Thy sight
	And save me through the coming night.

	2. The joys of day are over;
	I lift my heart to Thee
	And ask Thee that offenseless
	The hours of dark may be.
	O Jesus, keep me in Thy sight
	And guard me through the coming night.

	3. The toils of day are over:
	I raise the hymn to Thee
	And ask that free from peril
	The hours of dark may be.
	O Jesus, make their darkness light
	And guard me through the coming night.

	4. Lord, that in death I sleep not,
	And lest my Foe should say
	"I have prevailed against him,"
	Lighten mine eyes, I pray.
	O Jesus, keep me in Thy sight
	And guard me through the coming night.

	5. Be Thou my Soul's Preserver,
	O God, for Thou dost know
	How many are the perils
	Through which I have to go.
	Lover of men, oh, hear my call
	And guard and save me from them all.

	1. O God, be with us, for the night is falling;
	1. O God, be with us, for the night is falling;
	For Thy protection we to Thee are calling;
	Beneath Thy shadow to our rest we yield us;
	Thou, Lord, wilt shield us.

	2. May evil fancies flee away before us;
	Till morning cometh, watch, O Father, o'er us;
	In soul and body Thou from harm defend us,
	Thine angel send us.

	3. While we are sleeping, keep us in Thy favor;
	When we awaken, let us never waver
	All day to serve Thee, Thy due praise pursuing
	In all our doing.

	4. Through Thy Beloved soothe the sick and weeping
	And bid the captive lose his grief in sleeping;
	Widows and orphans, we to Thee commend them,
	Do Thou befriend them.

	5. We have no refuge, none on earth to aid us,
	Save Thee, O Father, who Thine own hast made us.
	But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely
	Who seek Thee only.

	6. Thy name be hallowed and Thy kingdom given,
	Thy will among us done as 'tis in heaven;
	Feed us, forgive us, from all ill deliver
	Now and forever.

	1. At even, when the sun did set,
	1. At even, when the sun did set,
	The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay
	Oh, in what divers pain they met!
	Oh, with what joy they went away!

	2. Once more 'tis eventide, and we,
	Oppressed with various ills, draw near.
	What if Thy from we cannot see,
	We know and feel that Thou art here.

	3. O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;
	For some are sick, and some are sad,
	And some have never loved Thee well,
	And some have lost the love they had;

	4. And some are pressed with worldly care,
	And some are tried with sinful doubt;
	And some such grievous passions tear
	That only Thou canst cast them out;

	5. And some have found the world is vain,
	Yet from the world they break not free;
	And some have friends who give them pain,
	Yet have not sought a friend in Thee;

	6. And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
	For none are wholly free from sin;
	And they who fain would serve Thee best
	Are conscious most of wrong within.

	7. O Savior Christ, Thou too, art man;
	Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried.
	Thy kind but searching glance can scan
	The very wounds that shame would hide.

	8. Thy touch has still its ancient power,
	No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
	Hear in this solemn evening hour
	And in Thy mercy heal us all.
	Amen.
        1. All praise to Thee, my God, this night
        1. All praise to Thee, my God, this night
        For all the blessings of the light.
        Keep me, oh, keep me, King of kings,
        Beneath Thy own almighty wings.

        2. Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
        The ill that I this day have done
        That with the world, myself and Thee,
        I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

        3. Teach me to live that I may dread
        The grave as little as my bed.
        Teach me to die that so I may
        Rise glorious at the awe-ful Day.

        4. Oh, may my soul on Thee repose,
        And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
        Sleep that shall me more vigorous make
        To serve my God when I awake.

        5. When in the night I sleepless lie,
        My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
        Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
        No powers of darkness me molest.

        6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
        Praise Him, all creatures here below;
        Praise Him above, ye heavenly host:
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

        1. O Christ, who art the Light and Day,
        1. O Christ, who art the Light and Day,
        Thou drivest night and gloom away;
        O Light of light, whose Word doth show
        The light of heaven to us below.

        2. All-holy Lord, in humble prayer,
        We ask tonight Thy watchful care.
        Oh, grant us calm repose in Thee,
        A quiet night, from perils free.

        3. Our sleep be pure from sinful stain;
        Let not the Tempter vantage gain,
        Or our unguarded flesh surprise
        And make us guilty in Thine eyes.

        4. Asleep though wearied eyes may be,
        Still keep the heart awake to Thee;
        Let Thy right hand outstretched above
        Guard those who serve the Lord they love.

        5. Behold, O God, our Shield, and quell
        The crafts and subtleties of hell;
        Direct Thy servants in all good,
        Who Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.

        6. O Lord, remember us who bear
        The burden of the flesh we wear;
        Thou who dost o'er our souls defend,
        Be with us even to the end.

        7. All praise to God the Father be,
        All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
        Whom with the Spirit we adore
        Forever and forevermore.

	1. Now that the day has reached its close,
	1. Now that the day has reached its close,
	The sun doth shine no more,
	In sleep the toil-worn find repose
	And all who wept before.

	2. But Thou, my God, dost never sleep,
	For Thou Thyself art Light;
	No darkness, howsoever deep,
	Can dim Thy perfect sight.

	3. Therefore, O Lord, remember me
	Throughout the gloom of night,
	Protect Thou me most graciously
	And shield me with Thy might.

	4. Keep satan's fury far from me
	By many an angel arm;
	Then shall I be from worry free
	And safe from every harm.

	5. I know the evil I have done
	Doth cry aloud to Thee;
	But yet in mercy Thy dear Son
	Hath full atoned for me.

	6. In Him accepted I shall be
	When suppliant at Thy feet,
	He is my Surety and my Plea
	Before Thy judgment-seat.

	7. And so I close my weary eyes,
	Sweet peace within my breast,
	Why toss about in fears or sighs?
	God watches while I rest.

	8. Should this night prove the last for me
	In this sad vale of cares,
	Then lead me, Lord, to dwell with Thee
	And all Thy chosen heirs.

	9. And thus I live and die to Thee,
	Strong Lord of hosts indeed.
	In life, in death, deliver me
	From every fear and need.

	1. Round me falls the night;
	1. Round me falls the night;
	Savior, be my Light.
	Through the hours in darkness shrouded
	Let me see Thy face unclouded;
	Let Thy glory shine
	In this heart of mine.

	2. Earthly work is done,
	Earthly sounds are none,
	Rest in sleep and silence seeking,
	Let me hear Thee softly speaking;
	In my spirit's ear
	Whisper, "I am near."

	3. Blessed, heavenly Light
	Shining through earth's night;
	Voice that oft of love hast told me;
	Arms so strong to clasp and hold me,
	Thou Thy watch wilt keep,
	Savior, o'er my sleep.

        1. The sun's last beam of light is gone,
        1. The sun's last beam of light is gone,
        The shades of night come swiftly on;
        O Christ, our Light, upon us shine
        Lest we to sin's dark ways incline.

        2. We thank Thee that throughout the day
        Thine angles kept all harm away.
        Thy grace from care and vexing fear
        Hath led us on in safety here.

        3. Lord, if we angered Thee today,
        Remember not our sins, we pray,
        But let Thy mercy o'er them sweep,
        And give us calm and restful sleep.

        4. Let angels guard our sleeping hours
        And drive away all evil powers;
        Our soul and body, while we sleep,
        In safety, gracious Father, keep.

	1. O Trinity, most blessed Light,
	1. O Trinity, most blessed Light,
	O Unity of sovereign might,
	As now the fiery sun departs,
	Shed Thou Thy beams within our hearts.

	2. To Thee our morning songs of praise,
	To Thee our evening prayer we raise;
	Thee may our glory evermore
	In lowly reverence adore.

	3. All praise to God the Father be,
	All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
	Whom with the Spirit we adore
	Forever and forevermore.

	1. Savior, breathe an evening blessing
	1. Savior, breathe an evening blessing
	Ere repose our spirits seal,
	Sin and want we come confessing;
	Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

	2. Though destruction walk around us,
	Though the arrows past us fly,
	Angel guards from Thee surround us;
	We are safe if Thou art nigh.

	3. Though the night be dark and dreary,
	Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
	Thou art He who, never weary,
	Watcheth where Thy people be.

	4. Should swift death this night o'ertake us
	And our couch become our tomb,
	May the morn in heaven awake us,
	Clad in light and deathless bloom.

	1. Christ, by heavenly host adored,
	1. Christ, by heavenly host adored,
	Gracious, mighty, sovereign Lord
	God of nations, King of kings,
	Head of all created things,
	By the Church with Joy confest,
	God o'er all forever blest,--
	Pleading at Thy throne we stand,
	Save Thy people, bless our land.
	
	2. On our fields of grass and grain
	Send, 0 Lord, the kindly rain;
	O'er our wide and goodly land
	Crown the labors of each hand.
	Let Thy kind protection be
	O'er our commerce on the sea.
	Open, Lord, Thy bounteous hand;
	Bless Thy people, bless our land.
	
	3. Let our rulers ever be
	Men that love and honor Thee;
	Let the powers by Thee ordained
	Be in righteousness maintained.
	In the people's hearts increase
	Love of piety and peace.
	Thus united, we shall stand
	One wide, free, and happy land.

	1. 0 Lord, whose bounteous hand again
	1. 0 Lord, whose bounteous hand again
	Hath poured Thy gifts in plenty down,
	Who all, creation dost sustain
	And all the earth with goodness crown,
	Lord of the harvest, here we own
	Our joy to be Thy gift alone.
	
	2. Oh, may we ne'er with thankless heart
	Forget from whom our blessings flow!
	Still, Lord, Thy heavenly.grace impart;
	Still teach us what to Thee we owe.
	Lord, may our lives with fruit divine
	Return Thy care and prove us Thine.
	
	3. Lord, grant that we who sow to Thee
	With joy in endless life may reap.
	Of every heart the Guardian be;
	By day and night Thy servants keep
	That all to Thee may joy afford
	On Thy great harvest-day, 0 Lord.
	
        1. We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator,
        1. We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator,
        In grateful devotion our tribute we bring;
        We lay it before Thee, We kneel and adore Thee,
        We bless Thy holy name, glad praises we sing.

        2. We worship Thee, God of our fathers, we bless Thee;
        Through life's storm and tempest our Guide hast Thou been;
        When perils o'ertake us, Escape Thou wilt make us,
        And with Thy help, O Lord, our battles we win.

        3. With voices united our praises we offer,
        To Thee, great Jehovah, glad anthems we raise.
        Thy strong arm will guide us, Our God is beside us,
        To Thee, our great Redeemer, fore'er be praise.

        1. O Lord, I sing with lips and heart,
        1. O Lord, I sing with lips and heart,
        Joy of my soul, to Thee;
        To earth Thy knowledge I impart
        As it is known to me.

        2. Thou art the Fount of grace, I know,
        And Spring so full and free
        Whence saving health and goodness flow
        Each day so bounteously.

        3. For what have all that live and move
        Through this wide world below
        That does not from Thy bounteous love,
        O heavenly Father, flow?

        4. Who built the lofty firmament?
        Who spread the expanse of blue?
        By whom are to our pastures sent
        Refreshing rain and dew?

        5. Who warmeth us in cold and frost?
        Who shields us from the wind?
        Who orders it that fruit and grain
        We in their season find?

        6. Who is it life and health bestows?
        Who keeps us with His hand
        In golden peace, wards off war's woes
        From our dear native land?

        7. O Lord, of this and all our store
        Thou art the Author blest;
        Thou keepest watch before our door
        While we securely rest.

        8. Thou feedest us from year to year
        And constant dost abide;
        With ready help in time of fear
        Thou standest at our side.

        9.  Our deepest need dost Thou supply
        And all that lasts for aye;
        Thou leadest to our home on high,
        When hence we pass away.

        1. Praise, oh, praise, our God and King,
        1. Praise, oh, praise, our God and King,
        Hymns of adoration sing;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        2. Praise Him that He made the sun
        Day by day his course to run;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        3. And the silver moon by night,
        Shining with her gentle light;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        4. Praise Him that He gave the rain
        To mature the swelling grain;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        5. And hath bid the fruitful field
        Crops of precious increase yield;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        6. Praise Him for our harvest store,
        He hath filled the garner floor;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        7. And for richer food than this,
        Pledge of everlasting bliss;
        For His mercies still endure,
        Ever faithful, ever sure.

        8. Glory to our bounteous King,
        Glory let creation sing;
        Glory to the Father, Son,
        And the Spirit, Three in One!

        1. What our Father does is well:
        1. What our Father does is well:
        Blessed truth His children tell!
        Though He send, for plenty, want,
        Though the harvest-store be scant,
        Yet we rest upon His love,
        Seeking better things above.

        2. What our Father does is well,
        Shall the wilful heart rebel
        If a blessing He withhold
        In the field or in the fold?
        Is He not Himself to be
        All our store eternally?

        3. What our Father does is well,
        Though He sadden hill and dell,
        Upward yet our praises rise
        For the strength His Word supplies.
        He has called us sons of God;
        Can we murmur at His rod?

        4. What our Father does is well,
        May the thought within us dwell!
        Though no milk nor honey flow
        In our barren Canaan now,
        God can save us in our need,
        God can bless us, God can feed.

        5. Therefore unto Him we raise
        Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
        To the Father and the Son
        And the Spirit, Three in One,
        Honor, might, and glory be
        Now and through eternity.

        1. Praise to God, immortal praise,
        1. Praise to God, immortal praise,
        For the love that crowns our days;
        Bounteous Source of every joy,
        Let Thy praise our tongues employ,
        All to Thee, our God, we owe,
        Source whence all our blessings flow.

        2. All the plenty summer pours;
        Autumn's rich, o'erflowing stores;
        Flocks that whiten all the plain;
        Yellow sheaves of ripened grain, --
        Lord, for these our souls shall raise
        Grateful vows and solemn praise.

        3. Peace, prosperity, and health,
        Private bliss, and public wealth,
        Knowledge with its gladdening streams,
        True religion's holier beams,
        Lord, for these our souls shall raise
        Grateful vows and solemn praise.

        4. As Thy prospering hand hath blest,
        May we give Thee all our best
        And by deeds of kindly love
        For Thy mercies grateful prove,
        Singing thus through all our days
        Praise to God, immortal praise.

        1. To Thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise
        1. To Thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise
        In hymns of adoration,
        To Thee bring sacrifice of praise
        With shout of exultation.
        Bright robes of gold the fields adorn,
        The hills with joy are ringing,
        The valleys stand so thick with corn
        That even they are singing.

        2. And now, on this our festal day,
        Thy bounteous hand confessing,
        Upon Thine altar, Lord, we lay
        The first-fruits of Thy blessing.
        By Thee the souls of men are fed
        With gifts of grace supernal;
        Thou who dost give us earthly bread,
        Give us the Bread eternal.

        3. We bear the burden of the day,
        And often toil seems dreary;
        But labor ends with sunset ray,
        And rest comes for the weary.
        May we, the angel-reaping o'er,
        Stand at the last accepted,
        Christ's golden sheaves forevermore,
        To garners bright elected.

        4. Oh, blessed is that land of God
        Where saints abide forever,
        Where golden fields spread fair and broad,
        Where flows the crystal river.
        The strains of all its holy throng
        With ours today are blending;
        Thrice blessed is that harvest-song
        Which never hath an ending.

        1. Come, ye thankful people, come;
        1. Come, ye thankful people, come;
        Raise the song of Harvest-home.
        All be safely gathered in
        Ere the winter storms begin;
        God, our Maker, doth provide
        For our wants to be supplied,
        Come to God's own temple, come;
        Raise the song of Harvest-home.

        2. All the world is God's own field,
        Fruit unto His praise to yield;
        Wheat and tares together sown,
        Unto joy or sorrow grown;
        First the blade and then the ear,
        Then the full corn shall appear.
        Lord of harverst, grant that we
        Wholesome grain and pure may be.

        3. For the Lord, our God, shall come
        And shall take His harvest home;
        From His field shall in that day
        All offences purge away;
        Give His angels charge at last
        In the fire the tares to cast,
        But the fruitful ears to store
        In His garner evermore.

        4. Even so, Lord, quickly come
        To Thy final Harvest-home;
        Gather Thou Thy people in,
        Free from sorrow, free from sin,
        There, forever purified,
        In Thy garner to abide.
        Come with all Thine angels, come,
        Raise the glorious Harvest-home.

        1. Before the Lord we bow,
        1. Before the Lord we bow,
        The God who reigns above
        And rules the world below
        In boundless pow'r and love.
        Our thanks we bring,
        In joy and praise
        Our hearts we raise
        To heav'n's high King.

        2. The nation Thou hast blest
        May well Thy love declare,
        From foes and fears at rest,
        Protected by Thy care.
        For this fair land,
        For this bright day,
        Our thanks we pay--
        Gifts of Thy hand.

        3. May ev'ry mountain height,
        Each vale and forest green,
        Shine in Thy Word's pure light
        And its rich fruits be seen!
        May ev'ry tongue
        Be tuned to praise
        And join to raise
        A grateful song!

        4. Earth, hear thy Maker's voice,
        Thy great Redeemer own;
        Believe, obey, rejoice,
        And worship Him alone.
        Cast down thy pride,
        Thy sin deplore,
        And bow before
        The Crucified.

        5. And when in power He comes,
        Oh, may our native land
        From all its rending tombs
        Send forth a glorious band,
        A countless throng,
        For aye to sing
        To heaven's high King
        Salvation's song!

        1. Judge eternal, throned in splendor,
        1. Judge eternal, throned in splendor,
        Lord of lords and King of kings,
        With Thy living fire of judgment
        Purge this realm of bitter things;
        Solace all its wide dominion
        With the healing of Thy wings.

        2. Still the weary folk are pining
        For the hour that brings release;
        And the city's crowded clangor
        Cries aloud for sin to cease;
        And the homesteads and the woodlands
        Plead in silence for their peace.

        3. Crown, O God, Thine own endeavor;
        Cleave our darkness with Thy sword;
        Feed the faint and hungry peoples
        With the richness of Thy Word;
        Cleanse the body of this nation
        Thro the glory of the Lord.

        1. God bless our native land!
        1. God bless our native land!
        Firm may she ever stand
        Thro storm and night!
        When the wild tempests rave,
        Ruler of wind and wave
        Do Thou our country save
        By Thy great might.

        2. For her our prayer shall rise
        To God above the skies;
        On Him we wait.
        Thou who art ever nigh,
        Guarding with watchful eye,
        To Thee aloud we cry,
        God save the State! Amen.

        1. Lord, while for all mankind we pray
        1. Lord, while for all mankind we pray
        Of ev'ry clime and coast,
        Oh, hear us for our native land,
        The land we love the most!

        2. Oh, guard our shores from ev'ry foe,
        With peace our borders bless,
        With prosp'rous times our cities crown,
        Our fields with plenteousness!

        3. Unite us in the sacred love
        Of knowledge, truth, and Thee;
        And let our hills and valleys shout
        The songs of liberty.

        4. Here may Thy Gospel, pure and mild,
        Smile on our Sabbath hours
        And piety and virtue bless
        Our fathers home and ours.

        5. Lord of the nations, thus to Thee
        Our country we commend.
        Be Thou her Refuge and her Trust,
        Her everlasting Friend.

        1. Almighty Lord, before Thy throne
        1. Almighty Lord, before Thy throne
        Thy mourning people bend;
        'Tis on Thy grace in Christ alone
        Our failing hopes depend.

        2. Dark judgments from Thy heavy hand
        Thy dreadful pow'r display;
        Yet mercy spares our guilty land,
        And still we live to pray.

        3. How changed, alas, are truths divine
        For error, guilt, and shame!
        What impious numbers, bold in sin,
        Disgrace the Christian name!

        4. Oh, turn us, turn us, mighty Lord;
        Convert us by Thy grace!
        Then shall our hearts obey Thy Word
        And see again Thy face.

        5. Then, should oppressing foes invade,
        We will not yield to fear,
        Secure of all-sufficient aid
        When God in Christ is near.

        1. To Thee, our God, we fly
        1. To Thee, our God, we fly
        For mercy and for grace;
        Oh, hear our lowly cry
        And hide not Thou Thy face!
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        2. Arise, O Lord of hosts,
        Be jealous for Thy name
        And drive from out our coasts
        The sins that put to shame.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        3. Thy best gifts from on high
        In rich abundance pour
        That we may magnify
        And praise Thee more and more.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        4. The powers ordained by Thee
        With heavenly wisdom bless;
        May they Thy servants be
        And rule in righteousness!
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        5. The Church of Thy dear Son
        Inflame with love's pure fire;
        Bind her once more in one
        And life and truth inspire.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        6. The pastors of Thy fold
        With grace and power endue
        That, faithful, pure, and bold,
        They may be pastors true.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        7. Oh, let us love Thy house
        And sanctify Thy day,
        Bring unto Thee our vows,
        And loyal homage pay.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        8. Give peace, Lord, in our time;
        Oh, let no foe draw nigh
        Nor lawless deed of crime
        Insult Thy majesty!
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        9. Though vile and worthless, still
        Thy people, Lord, are we;
        And for our God we will
        None other have but Thee.
        O Lord, stretch forth Thy mighty hand
        And guard and bless our Fatherland.

        1. All ye who on this earth do dwell,
        1. All ye who on this earth do dwell,
        Give thanks and glorify
        The Lord whose praises ever swell
        In seraph songs on high.

        2. Lift up your hearts in praise to God,
        Himself best Gift of all,
        Who works His wonders all abroad,
        Upholding great and small.

        3. Since first our life began to be,
        He has preserved our frame;
        And when man's strength was vanity,
        He as our Helper came.

        4. Though often we His patience try
        And well deserve His frown,
        In grace He lays His anger by
        And pours new blessings down.

        5. 'Tis He revives our fainting soul,
        Gives joyful hearts to men;
        And when great waves of trouble roll,
        He drives them back again.

        6. May He adorn with precious peace
        Our own, our native, land
        And crown with joys that never cease
        The labors of our hand.

        7. Long as we tarry here below
        Our saving Health is He;
        And when from earth to heaven we go,
        May He our portion be!

        1. God, Lord of Sabaoth, Thou who ordainest
        1. God, Lord of Sabaoth, Thou who ordainest
        Thunder Thy clarion and lightning Thy sword,
        Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest;
        Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

        2. God, the omnipotent, mighty Avenger,
        Watching invisible, judging unheard;
        Save us in mercy, oh, save us from danger;
        Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

        3. God, the All-merciful, earth hath forsaken
        Thy ways all holy and slighted Thy Word;
        Let not Thy wrath in its terror awaken;
        Give to us pardon and peace, O Lord.

        4. So shall Thy people, with thankful devotion,
        Praise Him who saved them from peril and sword,
        Singing in chorus, from ocean to ocean,
        Peace to the nations and praise to the Lord.

        1. Great King of nations, hear our prayer
        1. Great King of nations, hear our prayer
        While at Thy feet we fall
        And humbly with united cry
        To Thee for mercy call.
        The guilt is ours, but grace is Thine;
        Oh, turn us not away,
        But hear us from Thy lofty throne
        And help us when we pray.

        2. Our fathers sins were manifold,
        And ours no less we own;
        Yet wondrously from age to age
        Thy goodness hath been shown.
        When dangers, like a stormy sea,
        Beset our country round,
        To Thee we looked, to Thee we cried,
        And help in Thee was found.

        3. With one consent we meekly bow
        Beneath Thy chast'ning hand
        And, pouring forth confession meet,
        Mourn with our mourning land.
        With pitying eye behold our need
        As thus we lift our prayer;
        Correct us with Thy judgments, Lord,
        Then let Thy mercy spare.

        1. Swell the anthem, raise the song;
        1. Swell the anthem, raise the song;
        Praises to our God belong.
        Saints and angels join to sing
        Praises to the heav'nly King.
        Blessings from His lib'ral hand
        Flow around this happy land.
        Kept by Him, no foes annoy;
        Peace and freedom we enjoy.

        2. Here, beneath a peaceful sway,
        May we cheerfully obey,
        Never feel oppression's rod,
        Ever own and worship God.
        Hark, the voice of nature sings
        Praises to the King of kings.
        Let us join the choral song
        And the grateful notes prolong. Amen.

        1. I fall asleep in Jesus wounds,
        1. I fall asleep in Jesus wounds,
        There pardon for my sins abounds;
        Yea, Jesus blood and righteousness
        My jewels are, my glorious dress.
        In these before my God I'll stand
        When I shall reach the heavenly land.

        2. With peace and joy I now depart;
        God's child I am with all my heart.
        I thank thee, Death, thou leadest me
        To that true life where I would be.
        So cleansed by Christ, I fear not death.
        Lord Jesus, strengthen Thou my faith.

	1. Asleep, in Jesus! Blessed sleep,
	1. Asleep, in Jesus! Blessed sleep,
	From which none ever wakes to weep;
	A calm and undisturbed repose,
	Unbroken by the last of foes.
	
	2. Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet
	To be for such a slumber meet,
	With holy confidence to sing
	That death has lost his venomed sting!
	
	3. Asleep tn Jesus! Peaceful rest,
	Whose waking is supremely blest
	No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
	That manifests the Savior's power.
	
	4. Asleep In Jesus! Oh, for me
	May such a blissful refuge be!
	Securely shall my ashes lie
	And wait the summons from on high.
	
          1. I would not live alway; I ask not to stay
          1. I would not live alway; I ask not to stay
          Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way.
          The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here
          Suffice for life's woes, are enough for its cheer.

          2. I would not Ilve alway; thus fettered by sin,
          Temptation without and corruption within;
          E'en rapture of pardon is mingled with fears,
          The cup of thanksgiving with penitent tears.

          3. I would not live alway; no, welcome the tomb:
          Since Jesus hath lain there, I dread not its gloom.
          There sweet be my rest till He bids me arise
          To hail Him in triumph descending the skies.

          4. Ah, who would live alway, away from his God,
          Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode,
          Where rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains
          And noontide of glory eternally reigns;

          5. Where saints of all ages in harmony meet
          Their Savior and brethren transported to greet,
          While anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,
          The smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul?

	1. Oh, how blest are ye whose toils are ended,
	1. Oh, how blest are ye whose toils are ended,
	Who through death have unto God ascended!
	Ye have arisen
	From the cares which keep us still in prison.
	
	2. We are still as in a dungeon living,
	Still oppressed with sorrow and misgiving;
	Our undertackings
	Are but toils and troubles and heart-breakings.
	
	3. Ye meanwhile are in your chambers sleeping,
	Quiet, and set free from all our weeping;
	No cross or sadness
	There can hinder your untroubled gladness.
	
	4. Christ has wiped away your tears forever;
	Ye have that for which we still endeavor;
	To you are chanted
	Songs that ne'er to mortal ears were granted.
	
	5. Ah, who would, then, not depart with gladness
	To inherit heaven for earthly sadness?
	Who here would languish
	Longer in bewailing and in anguish?
	
	6. Come, 0 Christ, and loose the chains that bind us:
	Lead us forth and cast this world behind us.
	With Thee, the Anointed,
	Finds the soul its joy and rest appointed.

        1. In the midst of earthly life
        1. In the midst of earthly life
        Snares of death surround us;
        Who shall help us in the strife
        Lest the Foe confound us?
        Thou only, Lord, Thou only.
        We mourn that we have greatly erred,
        That our sins Thy wrath have stirred.
        Holy and righteous God!
        Holy and mighty God!
        Holy and all-merciful Savior!
        Eternal Lord God!
        Save us lest we perish
        In the bitter pangs of death.
        Have mercy, O Lord!

        2. In the midst of death's dark vale
        Powers of hell o'ertake us.
        Who will help when they assail,
        Who secure will make us?
        Thou only, Lord, Thou only.
        Thy heart is moved with tenderness,
        Pities us in our distress.
        Holy and righteous God!
        Holy and mighty God!
        Holy and all-merciful Savior!
        Eternal Lord God!
        Save us lest we perish
        In the bitter pangs of death.
        Have mercy, O Lord!

        3. In the midst of utter woe
        All our sins oppress us,
        Where shall we for refuge go,
        Where for grace to bless us?
        To Thee, Lord Jesus, only.
        Thy precious blood was shed to win
        Full atonement for our sin.
        Holy and righteous God!
        Holy and mighty God!
        Holy and all-merciful Savior!
        Eternal Lord God!
        Save us lest we perish
        In the bitter pangs of death.
        Have mercy, O Lord!

	1. Jesus, I live to Thee,
	1. Jesus, I live to Thee,
	The Loveliest and Best;
	My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
	In Thy blest love I rest.
	
	2. Jesus, I die to Thee
	Whenever death shall come;
	To die in Thee is life to me
	In my eternal home.
	
	3. Whether to live or die
	I know not which is best:
	To live in Thee is bliss to me,
	To die is endless rest.
	
	4. Living or dying, Lord,
	I ask but to be Thine;
	My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
	Make heaven forever mine.
	
        1. I know of a sleep in Jesus name,
        1. I know of a sleep in Jesus name,
        A rest from all toil and sorrow;
        Earth folds in her arms my weary frame
        And shelters it till the morrow;
        My soul is at home with God in heaven,
        Her sorrows are past and over.

        2. I know of a peaceful eventide;
        And when I am faint and weary,
        At times with the journey sorely tried,
        Through hours that are long and dreary,
        Then often I yearn to lay me down
        And sink into blissful slumber.

        3. I know of a morning bright and fair
        When tidings of joy shall wake us,
        When songs of from on high shall fill the air
        And God to His glory take us,
        When Jesus shall bid us rise from sleep, --
        How joyous that hour of waking!

        4. Oh, that is a morning dear to me,
        And oft, o'er the mountains streaming,
        In spirit its heavenly light I see
        As golden the peaks are beaming.
        Then sing I for joy like birds at dawn
        That carol in lofty lindens.

        5. God's Son to our graves then takes His way,
        His voice hear all tribes and nations;
        The portals are rent that guard our clay,
        And moved are the sea's foundations.
        He calls out aloud: "Ye dead, come forth!"
        In glory we rise to meet Him.

        6. O Jesus, draw near my dying bed
        And take me into Thy keeping
        And say when my spirit hence is fled,
        "This child is not dead, but sleeping."
        And leave me not, Savior, till I rise
        To praise Thee in life eternal.

	1. Why do we mourn departing friends
	1. Why do we mourn departing friends
	Or shake at death's alarms?
	'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
	To call them to His arms.
	
	2. Are we not tending upward, too,
	As fast as time can move?
	Nor would we wish the hours more slow
	To keep us from our Love.
	
	3. Why should we tremble to convey
	Their bodies to the tomb?
	There the dear flesh of Jesus lay
	And scattered all the gloom.
	
	4. The graves of all the saints He blessed
	And softened every bed.
	Where should the dying members rest
	But with their dying Head?
	
	5. Thence He arose, ascending high,
	And showed our feet the way.
	Up to the Lord we, too, shall fly
	At the great rising-day.
	
	6. Then let the last loud trumpet sound
	And bid our kindred rise:
	Awake, ye nations under ground!
	Ye saints, ascend the skies!
	
        1. When my last hour is close at hand,
        1. When my last hour is close at hand,
        Lord Jesus Christ, attend me;
        Beside me then, O Savior, stand
        To comfort and defend me.
        Into Thy hands I will commend
        My soul at this my earthly end,
        And Thou wilt keep it safely.

        2. My sins, dear Lord, disturb me sore,
        My conscience cannot slumber;
        But though as sands upon the shore
        My sins may be in number,
        I will not quail, but think of Thee;
        Thy death, Thy sorrow, borne for me,
        Thy sufferings, shall uphold me.

        3. I am a branch in Thee, the Vine,
        And hence the comfort borrow
        That Thou wilt surely keep me Thine
        Through fear and pain and sorrow;
        And when I die, I die to Thee,
        Thy precious death hath won for me
        The life that never endeth.

        4. Since Thou the power of death didst rend,
        In death Thou wilt not leave me;
        Since Thou didst into heaven ascend,
        No fear of death shall grieve me.
        For where Thou art, there shall I be
        That I may ever live with Thee;
        That is my hope when dying.

        5. My spirit I commend to Thee
        And gladly hence betake me;
        Peaceful and calm my sleep shall be,
        No human voice can wake me.
        But Christ is with me through the strife,
        And He will bear me into life
        And open heaven before me.

	1. Tender Shepherd, Thou hast stilled
	1. Tender Shepherd, Thou hast stilled
	Now Thy little lamb's brief weeping.
	Ah, how peaceful and how mild
	In its narrow bed 'tis sleeping!
	And no sigh of anguish sore
	Heaves that little bosom more.
	
	2. In this world of pain and care,
	Lord, Thou wouldst no longer leave it;
	To Thy heavenly meadows fair
	Lovingly Thou dost receive it.
	Clothed in robes of spotless white,
	Now it dwells with Thee in light.
	
	3. 0 Lord Jesus, grant that we
	There may live where it is living,
	There the blissful pastures see
	That it heavenly food are giving.
	Lost a while our treasured love,
	Gained forever, safe above.

	1. For me to live Is Jesus.  
	1. For me to live Is Jesus.  
	To die is gain for me;
	Then, whensoe'er He pleases,
	I meet death willingly.
	
	2. For Christ, my Lord and Brother,
	I leave this world so dim
	And gladly seek that other,
	Where I shall be with Him.
	
	3. My woes are nearly over,
	Though long and dark the road;
	My sin His merits cover,
	And I have peace with God.
	
	4. Lord, when my powers are failing,
	My breath comes heavily,
	And words are unavailing.
	Oh, hear my sighs to Thee!
	
	5. When mind and thought, 0 Savior,
	Are flickering like a light
	That to and fro doth waver
	Ere 'tis extinguished quite,
	
	6. In that last hour, oh, grant me
	To slumber soft and still,
	No doubts to vex or haunt me,
	Safe anchored on Thy will;
	
	7. And so to Thee still cleaving
	Through all death's agony,
	To fall asleep believing
	And wake in heaven with Thee.
	
	8.Amen! Thou, Christ, my Savior.
	Wilt grant this unto me.
	Thy Spirit lead me ever
	That I fare happily.

	1. Who knows when death may overtake me!
	1. Who knows when death may overtake me!
	Time passes on, my end draws near.
	How swiftly can my breath forsake me!
	How soon can life's last hour appear!
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.

	2. The world that smiled when morn was breaking
	May change for me ere close of day;
	For while on earth my home I'm making,
	Death's threat is never far away.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	3. My end to ponder teach me ever
	And, ere the hour of death appears,
	To cast my soul on Christ, my Savior,
	Nor spare repentant sighs and tears.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	4. Help me now set my house in order
	That always ready I may be
	To say in meekness on death's border:
	Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	5. Reveal the sweetness of Thy heaven,
	Earth's galling bitterness unfold;
	May I, amid this turmoil riven,
	Thy blest eternity behold.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	6. My many sins blot out forever
	Since Jesus has my pardon won;
	In mercy robed I then shall never
	Fear death, but trust in Thee alone.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	7. Naught shall my soul from Jesus sever;
	In faith I touch His wounded side
	And hail Him as my Lord forever.
	Nor life nor death shall us divide.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	8. Once in the blest baptismal waters
	I put on Christ and made Him mine;
	Now numbered with God's sons and daughters,
	I share His peace and love divine.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	9. His body and His blood I've taken
	In His blest Supper, feast divine;
	Now I shall never be forsaken,
	For I am His, and He is mine.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	10. Then may death come today, tomorrow,
	I know in Christ I perish not;
	He grants the peace that stills all sorrow,
	Gives me a robe without a spot.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.
	
	11. And thus I live in God contented
	11. And thus I live in God contented
	And die without a thought of fear;
	My soul has to God's plans consented,
	For through His Son my faith is clear.
	My God, for Jesus sake I pray
	Thy peace may bless my dying day.

	1. 0 Lord, my God, I cry to Thee;
	1. 0 Lord, my God, I cry to Thee;
	In my distress Thou helpest me.
	My soul and body I commend
	Into Thy hands; Thine angel send
	To guide me home and cheer my heart
	When Thou dost call me to depart.
	
	2. 0 Jesus Christ, Thou Lamb of God,
	Once slain to take away our load.
	Now let Thy cross, Thine agony,
	Avail to save and solace me,
	Thy deam to open heaven, and there
	Bid me the joy of angels share.
	
	3. 0 Holy Spirit, faithful Friend,
	Grant me Thy comfort to the end.
	When death and hell assail me sore.
	Leave me, oh, leave me, nevermore,
	But bear me safely through the strife,
	As Thou hast promised. into life.
	
	1. All men Iiving are but mortal,
	1. All men Iiving are but mortal,
	Yea, all flesh must fade as grass;
	Only through death's gloomy portal
	To eternal Iife we pass.
	This frail body here must perish
	Ere the heavenly joys it cherish,
	Ere it gain the free reward
	For the ransomed of the Lord.
	
	2. Therefore, when my God doth choose it,
	Willingly I'll yield my Iife
	Nor will grieve that I should lose it,
	For with sorrows it was rife.
	In my dear Redeemer's merit
	Peace hath found my troubled spirit,
	And in death my comfort this:
	Jesus death my source of bliss.
	
	3. Jesus for my sake desended
	My salvation to obtain:
	Death and hell for me are ended,
	Peace and hope are now my gain;
	Yea with joy I leave earth's sadness
	For the home of heavenly gladness,
	Where I shall forever see
	God, the Holy Trinity.
	
	4. There is joy beyond our telling,
	Where so many saints have gone;
	Thousands, thousands, there are dwelling,
	Worshiping before the throne,
	There the Seraphim are shining,
	Evermore in chorus joining:
	"Holy, holy, holy, Lord!
	Triune God, for aye adored!"
	
	5. Patriarchs of sacred story
	And the prophets there are found;
	The apostles, too, in glory
	On twelve seats are there enthroned
	All the saints that have ascended
	Age on age, through time extended,
	There in blissful concert sing
	Hallelujahs to their King.
	
	6. O Jerusalem, how glorious
	Dost thou shine, thou city fair!
	Lo, I hear the tones victorious
	Ever sweetly sounding there.
	Oh, the bliss that there surprises!
	Lo, the sun of morn now rises,
	And the breaking day I see
	That shall never end for me.
	
	7. Yea, I see what here was told me,
	See that wondrous glory shine,
	Feel the spotless robes enfold me,
	Know a golden crown is mine.
	Thus before the throne so glorious
	Now I stand a soul victorious,
	Gazing on that joy for aye
	That shall never pass away.

	1. It is not death to die,
	1. It is not death to die,
	To leave this weary road,
	And midst the brotherhood on high
	To be at home with God.
	
	2. It is not death to close
	The eye long dimmed by tears
	And wake in glorious repose
	To spend eternal years.
	
	3. It is not death to bear
	The wrench that sets us free
	From dungeon chain, to breathe the air
	To spend eternal years.
	
	4. It is not death to fling
	Aside this sinful dust
	And rise, on strong, exulting wing,
	To live among the just.
	
	5. Jesus, Thou Prince of Iife,
	Thy chosen cannot die;
	Like Thee, they conquer in the strife
	To reign with Thee on high.

        1. Great God, what do I see and hear?
        1. Great God, what do I see and hear?
        The end of things created;
        The Judge of mankind doth appear
        On clouds of glory seated.
        The trumpet sounds; the graves restore
        The dead which they contained before:
        Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.

        2. The dead in Christ shall first arise
        At that last trumpet's sounding,
        Caught up to meet Him in the skies,
        With joy their Lord surrounding.
        No gloomy fears their souls dismay;
        His presence sheds eternal day
        On those prepared to meet Him.

        3. But sinners, filled with guilty fears,
        Behold His wrath prevailing,
        For they shall rise and find their tears
        And sighs are unavailing;
        The day of grace is past and gone;
        They trembling stand before his throne,
        All unprepared to meet Him.

        4. O Christ, who diedst and yet dost live,
        To me impart Thy merit;
        My pardon seal, my sins forgive,
        And cleanse me by Thy Spirit.
        Beneath Thy cross I view the day
        When heav'n and earth shall pass away,
        And thus prepare to meet Thee.

        1. The world is very evil,
        1. The world is very evil,
        The times are waxing late;
        Be sober and keep vigil,
        The Judge is at the gate;
        The Judge that comes in mercy,
        The Judge that comes with might,
        To terminate the evil,
        To diadem the right.

        2. Arise, arise, good Christian,
        Let right to wrong succeed;
        Let penitential sorrow
        To heav'nly gladness lead,
        To light that hath no evening,
        That knows no moon nor sun,
        The light so new and golden,
        The light that is but one.

        3. O home of fadeless splendor,
        Of flow'rs that bear no thorn,
        Where they shall dwell as children
        Who here as exiles mourn.
        Midst pow'r that knows no limit,
        Where knowledge has no bound,
        The beatific vision
        Shall glad the saints around.

        4. Strive, man, to win that glory;
        Toil, man, to gain that light;
        Send hope before to grasp it
        Till hope be lost in sight.
        Exult, O dust and ashes,
        The Lord shall be thy part;
        His only, His forever,
        Thou shalt be and thou art.

        5. O sweet and blessed country,
        The home of God's elect!
        O sweet and blessed country
        That eager hearts expect!
        Jesus, in mercy bring us
        To that dear land of rest,
        Who art, with God the Father
        And Spirit, ever blest.

        1. O'er the distant mountains breaking
        1. O'er the distant mountains breaking
        Comes the redd'ning dawn of day,
        Rise, my soul, from sleep awaking;
        Rise and sing and watch and pray.
        'Tis thy Savior,
        'Tis thy Savior,
        On His bright returning way.

        2. O Thou Long-expected, weary
        Waits my anxious soul for Thee;
        Life is dark, and earth is dreary,
        Where Thy light I do not see.
        O my Savior,
        O my Savior,
        When wilt Thou return to me?

        3. Nearer is my soul's salvation;
        Spent the night, the day at hand.
        Keep me in my lowly station,
        Watching for Thee till I stand,
        O my Savior,
        O my Savior,
        In Thy bright, Thy promised land.

        4. With my lamp well trimmed and burning,
        Swift to hear and slow to roam,
        Watching for Thy glad returning
        To restore me to my home.
        Come, my Savior,
        Come, my Savior,
        O my Savior, quickly come.

        1. Day of wrath, O day of mourning!
        1. Day of wrath, O day of mourning!
        See fulfilled the Prophet's warning,
        Heaven and earth in ashes burning.

        2. Oh, what fear man's bosom rendeth
        When from heav'n the Judge descendeth
        On whose sentence all dependeth!

        3. Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,
        Thro earth's sepulchers it ringeth,
        All before the throne it bringeth.

        4. Death is struck and nature quaking;
        All creation is awaking,
        To its Judge an answer making.

        5. Lo, the book, exactly worded,
        Wherein all hath been recorded;
        Thence shall judgment be awarded.

        6. When the Judge His seat attaineth
        And each hidden deed arraigneth,
        Nothing unavenged remaineth.

        7. What shall I, frail man, be pleading?
        Who for me be interceding
        When the just are mercy needing?

        8. King of majesty tremendous,
        Who dost free salvation send us,
        Fount of pity, then befriend us.

        9. Think, good Jesus, my salvation
        Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;
        Leave me not to reprobation!

        10. Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,
        On the cross of suffering bought me;
        Shall such grace be vainly brought me?

        11. Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution
        11. Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution
        Grant Thy gift of absolution
        Ere that day of retribution!

        12. Guilty, now I pour my moaning,
        All my shame with anguish owning:
        Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning!

        13. From that sinful woman shriven,
        From the dying thief forgiven,
        Thou to me a hope hast given.

        14. Worthless are my prayers and sighing;
        Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,
        Rescue me from fires undying.

        15. With Thy favored sheep, oh, place me!
        Nor among the goats abase me,
        But to Thy right hand upraise me.

        16. While the wicked are confounded,
        Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
        Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.

        17. Low I kneel with heart-submission,
        See, like ashes, my contrition;
        Help me in my last condition!

        18. Day of sorrow, day of weeping,
        When, in dust no longer sleeping,
        Man awakes in Thy dread keeping!

        19. To the rest Thou didst prepare me
        On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!
        Spare, O God, in mercy spare me!

        1. Let thoughtless thousands choose the road
        1. Let thoughtless thousands choose the road
        That leads the soul away from God;
        This happiness, dear Lord, be mine,
        To live and die entirely Thine.

        2. On Christ, by faith, I fain would live,
        From Him my life, my all, receive,
        To Him devote my fleeting hours,
        Serve Him alone with all my pow'rs.

        3. Christ is my everlasting All;
        To Him I look, on Him I call;
        He will my ev'ry want supply
        In time and thro eternity.

        4. Soon will the Lord, my Life, appear;
        Soon shall I end my trials here,
        Leave sin and sorrow, death and pain.
        To live is Christ, to die is gain.

        5. Soon will the saints in glory meet,
        Soon walk through every golden street,
        And sing on every blissful plain:
        To live is Christ, to die is gain.

        1. "Wake, awake, for night is flying,"
        1. "Wake, awake, for night is flying,"
        The watchmen on the heights are crying;
        "Awake, Jerusalem, arise!"
        Midnight hears the welcome voices
        And at the thrilling cry rejoices:
        "Oh, where are ye, ye virgins wise?
        The Bridegroom comes, awake!
        Your lamps with gladness take!
        Hallelujah!
        With bridal care
        Yourselves prepare
        To meet the Bridegroom, who is near."

        2. Zion hears the watchmen singing,
        And all her heart with joy is springing,
        She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
        For her Lord comes down all-glorious,
        The strong in grace, in truth victorious,
        Her Star is ris'n, her Light is come.
        "Now come, Thou Blessed One,
        Lord Jesus, God's own Son,
        Hail! Hosanna!
        The joyful call
        We answer all
        And follow to the nuptial hall."

        3. Now let all the heav'ns adore Thee,
        Let men and angels sing before Thee,
        With harp and cymbal's clearest tone.
        Of one pearl each shining portal,
        Where, dwelling with the choir immortal,
        We gather round Thy radiant throne.
        No vision ever brought,
        No ear hath ever caught,
        Such great glory;
        Therefore will we
        Eternally
        Sing hymns of praise and joy to Thee.

        1. And will the Judge descend,
        1. And will the Judge descend,
        And must the dead arise
        And not a single soul escape
        His all-discerning eyes?

        2. And from His righteous lips
        Shall this dread sentence sound
        And thro the num'rous guilty throng
        Spread black despair around:

        3. "Depart from Me, accursed,
        To everlasting flame,
        For rebel angels first prepared,
        Where mercy never came"?

        4. How will my heart endure
        The terrors of that Day
        When earth and heav'n before His face
        Astonished shrink away?

        5. But ere that trumpet shakes
        The mansions of the dead,
        Hark from the Gospel's cheering sound
        What joyful tidings spread:

        6. Ye sinners, seek His grace
        Whose wrath ye cannot bear;
        Fly to the shelter of His cross
        And find salvation there.

        1. The day is surely drawing near
        1. The day is surely drawing near
        When God's Son, the Anointed,
        Shall with great majesty appear
        As Judge of all appointed.
        All mirth and laughter then shall cease
        When flames on flames will still increase,
        As Scripture truly teacheth.

        2. A trumpet loud shall then resound
        And all the earth be shaken.
        Then all who in their graves are found
        Shall from their sleep awaken;
        But all that live shall in that hour
        By the Almighty's boundless pow'r
        Be changed at His commanding.

        3. A book is opened then to all,
        A record truly telling
        What each hath done, both great and small,
        When he on earth was dwelling;
        And ev'ry heart be clearly seen,
        And all be known as they have been
        In tho'ts and words and actions.

        4. Then woe to those who scorned the Lord
        And sought but carnal pleasures,
        Who here despised His precious Word
        And loved their earthly treasures!
        With shame and trembling they will stand
        And at the Judge's stern command
        To Satan be delivered.

        5. O Jesus, who my debt didst pay
        And for my sin wast smitten,
        Within the Book of Life, oh, may
        My name be also written!
        I will not doubt; I trust in Thee,
        From Satan Thou hast made me free
        And from all condemnation.

        6. Therefore my Intercessor be
        And for Thy blood and merit
        Declare my name from judgment free
        With all who life inherit,
        That I may see Thee face to face
        With all Thy saints in that blest place
        Which Thou for us hast purchased.

        7. O Jesus Christ, do not delay,
        But hasten our salvation;
        We often tremble on our way
        In fear and tribulation.
        Then hear us when we cry to Thee;
        Come, mighty Judge, and make us free
        From every evil! Amen.

        1. That day of wrath, that dreadful day,
        1. That day of wrath, that dreadful day,
        When heav'n and earth shall pass away!
        What pow'r shall be the sinner's stay?
        How shall he meet that dreadful day?

        2. When, shriv'ling like a parched scroll,
        The flaming heav'ns together roll;
        When louder yet, and yet more dread,
        Swells the high trump that wakes the dead,

        3. Lord, on that day, that wrathful day,
        When man to Judgment wakes from clay,
        Be Thou the trembling sinner's Stay,
        Tho heav'n and earth shall pass away.

        1. Jerusalem the golden,
        1. Jerusalem the golden,
        With milk and honey blest,
        Beneath thy contemplation
        Sink heart and voice opprest.
        I know not, oh, I know not,
        What joys await us there,
        What radiancy of glory,
        What bliss beyond compare.

        2. They stand, those halls of Zion,
        All jubilant with song
        And bright with many an angel
        And all the martyr throng.
        The Prince is ever in them;
        The daylight is serene;
        The pastures of the blessed
        Are decked in glorious sheen.

        3. There is the throne of David;
        And there, from care released,
        The shout of them that triumph,
        The song of them that feast;
        And they who with their Leader
        Have conquered in the fight
        Forever and forever
        Are clad in robes of white.

        4. O sweet and blessed country,
        The home of God's elect!
        O sweet and blessed country
        That eager hearts expect!
        Jesus, in mercy bring us
        To that dear land of rest,
        Who art, with God the Father
        And Spirit, ever blest.

        1. For thee, O dear, dear country,
        1. For thee, O dear, dear country,
        Mine eyes their vigils keep;
        For very love, beholding
        Thy happy name, they weep.
        The mention of thy glory
        Is unction to the breast
        And medicine in sickness
        And love and life and rest.

        2. O one, O only mansion,
        O Paradise of joy,
        Where tears are ever banished
        And smiles have no alloy!
        The Lamb is all thy splendor,
        The Crucified thy praise;
        His laud and benediction
        Thy ransomed people raise.

        3. With jasper glow thy bulwarks,
        Thy streets with em'ralds blaze;
        The sardius and the topaz
        Unite in thee their rays;
        Thine ageless walls are bonded
        With amethyst unpriced;
        The saints build up thy fabric,
        The cornerstone is Christ.

        4. Thou hast no shore, fair ocean;
        Thou hast no time, bright day,
        Dear fountain of refreshment
        To pilgrims far away!
        Upon the Rock of Ages
        They raise thy holy tower;
        Thine is the victor's laurel
        And thine the golden dower.

        5. O sweet and blessed country,
        The home of God's elect!
        O sweet and blessed country
        That eager hearts expect!
        Jesus, in mercy bring us
        To that dear land of rest,
        Who art, with God the Father
        And Spirit, ever blest.

        1. A rest remaineth for the weary;
        1. A rest remaineth for the weary;
        Arise, sad heart, and grieve no more;
        Tho long the way and dark and dreary,
        It endeth on the golden shore.
        Before His throne the Lamb will lead thee,
        On heav'nly pastures He will feed thee.
        Cast off thy burden, come with haste;
        Soon will the toil and strife be ended,
        The weary way which thou hast wended.
        *Sweet is the rest which thou shalt taste.

        2. The Father's house has many a dwelling,
        And there will be a place for thee.
        With perfect love His heart is welling
        Who loved thee from eternity.
        His precious blood the Lamb hath given
        That thou might'st share the joys of heaven,
        And now He calleth far and near:
        "Ye weary souls, cease your repining,
        Come while for you My light is shining;
        *Come, sweetest rest awaits you here!"

        3. O come, come all, ye weak and weary,
        Ye souls bowed down with many a care;
        Arise and leave your dungeons dreary
        And listen to His promise fair:
        "Ye bore your burdens meek and lowly,
        I will fulfil My pledge most holy,
        I'll be your Solace and your Rest.
        Ye are Mine own, I will requite you;
        Tho sin and Satan seek to smite you,
        *Rejoice! Your home is with the blest."

        4. There rest and peace in endless measure
        Shall be ours thro eternity;
        No grief, no care, shall mar our pleasure,
        And untold bliss our lot shall be.
        Oh, had we wings to hasten yonder--
        No more o'er earthly ills to ponder--
        To join the glad, triumphant band!
        Make haste, my soul, forget all sadness;
        For peace awaits thee, joy and gladness,--
        *The perfect rest is nigh at hand.

        1. "Forever with the Lord!"
        1. "Forever with the Lord!"
        Amen! so let it be,
        Life from the dead is in that word,
        'Tis immortality.

        2. Here in the body pent,
        Absent from Him, I roam,
        Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
        A day's march nearer home.

        3. My Father's house on high,
        Home of my soul, how near
        At times to faith's foreseeing eye
        Thy golden gates appear!

        4. Ah, then my spirit faints
        To reach the land I love,
        The bright inheritance of saints,
        Jerusalem above!

        5. "Forever with the Lord!"
        O Father, 'tis Thy will.
        The promise of that faithful word
        E'en here to me fulfil.

        6. Be Thou at my right hand,
        Then can I never fail.
        Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand;
        Fight Thou, and I'll prevail.

        7. So when my dying breath
        Shall rend the veil in twain,
        By death I shall escape from death
        And life eternal gain.

        8. Knowing as I am known,
        How shall I love that word
        And oft repeat before the throne,
        "Forever with the Lord!"

        1. There is an hour of peaceful rest
        1. There is an hour of peaceful rest
        To mourning wand'rers giv'n;
        There is a joy for souls distrest,
        A balm for ev'ry wounded breast:
        'Tis found above--in heav'n.

        2. There is a home for weary souls,
        By sin and sorrow driv'n--
        When tossed on life's tempestuous shoals,
        When storms arise and ocean rolls,
        And all is drear--but heav'n.

        3. There faith lifts up the tearless eye,
        To brighter prospects giv'n,
        And views the tempest passing by,
        The evening shadows quickly fly,
        And all serene--in heav'n.

        4. There fragrant flow'rs immortal bloom,
        And joys supreme are giv'n;
        There rays divine disperse the gloom;
        Beyond the confines of the tomb
        Appears the dawn of heav'n.

        1. Jerusalem, my happy home,
        1. Jerusalem, my happy home,
        Name ever dear to me,
        When shall my labors have an end?
        Thy joys when shall I see?

        2. When shall these eyes thy heav'n-built walls
        And pearly gates behold,
        Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
        And streets of shining gold?

        3. Oh, when, thou city of my God,
        Shall I thy courts ascend
        Where evermore the angels sing,
        Where Sabbaths have no end?

        4. Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there
        Around my Savior stand;
        And soon my friends in Christ below
        Will join the glorious band.

        5. Jerusalem, my happy home,
        When shall I come to thee?
        When shall my labors have an end?
        Thy joys when shall I see?

        6. O Christ, do Thou my soul prepare
        For that bright home of love
        That I may see Thee and adore
        With all Thy saints above.

        1. Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,
        1. Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,
        Would God I were in thee!
        My longing heart fain, fain to thee would fly,
        It will not stay with me.
        Far over vale and mountain,
        Far over field and plain,
        It hastes to seek its Fountain
        And leave this world of pain.

        2. O happy day and yet far happier hour,
        When wilt thou come at last,
        When fearless to my Father's love and pow'r,
        Whose promise standeth fast,
        My soul I gladly render?
        For surely will His hand
        Lead her with guidance tender
        To heav'n, her fatherland.

        3. A moment's space, and gently, wondrously,
        Released from earthly ties,
        Elijah's chariot bears her up to thee,
        Thro all these lower skies
        To yonder shining regions,
        While down to meet her come
        The blessed angel legions
        And bid her welcome home.

        4. O Zion, hail! Bright city, now unfold
        The gates of grace to me.
        How many a time I longed for thee of old
        Ere yet I was set free
        From yon dark life of sadness,
        Yon world of shadowy naught,
        And God had given the gladness,
        The heritage, I sought.

        5. What glorious throng and what resplendent host
        Comes sweeping swiftly down?
        The chosen ones on earth who wrought the most,
        The Church's brightest crown,
        Our Lord hath set to meet me,
        As in the far-off years
        Their words oft came to greet me
        In yonder land of tears.

        6. The partiarchs and prophets noble train,
        With all Christ's followers true,
        Who bore the cross and could the worst disdain
        That tyrants dared to do,
        I see them shine forever,
        All-glorious as the sun,
        Mid light that fadeth never,
        Their perfect freedom won.

        7. And when within that lovely Paradise
        At last I safely dwell,
        What songs of bliss shall from my lips arise,
        What joy my tongue shall tell,
        While all the saints are singing
        Hosannas o'er and o'er,
        Pure hallelujahs ringing
        Around me evermore!

        8. Unnumbered choirs before the shining throne
        Their joyful anthems raise
        Till heaven's glad halls are echoing with the tone
        Of that great hymn of praise
        And all its host rejoices,
        And all its blessed throng
        Unite their myriad voices
        In one eternal song.

	1. Lord, who at Cana's wedding-feast
	1. Lord, who at Cana's wedding-feast
	Didst as a guest appear,
	Thou dearer far than earthly guest,
	Voucesafe Thy presence here.
	For holy Thou indeed dost prove
	The marriage-vow to be,
	Proclaiming it a type of love
	Between the Church and Thee.

	2. This holy vow that man can make,
	The golden thread in life,
	The bond that none may dare to break,
	That bindeth man and wife,
	Which, blest by Thee, whate'er betides,
	No evil shall destroy,
	Through care-worn days each care divides,
	And doubles every joy.

	3. On those who now before Thee kneel,
	O Lord, Thy blessing pour,
	That each may wake the other's zeal
	To love Thee more and more.
	Oh, grant them here in peace to live,
	In purity and love,
	And, this world leaving, to receive
	A crown of life above.

	1. O Father, all creating,
	1. O Father, all creating,
	Whose wisdom, love, and power
	First bound two lives together
	In Eden's primal hour,
	Today to these Thy children
	Thine earliest gifts renew,--
	A home by Thee made happy,
	A love by Thee kept true.

	2. O Savior, Guest most bounteous
	Of old in Galilee,
	Voucesafe today Thy presence
	With these who call on Thee.
	Their store of earthly gladness
	Transform to heavenly wine
	And teach them, in the testing,
	To know the gift is Thine.

	3. O Spirit of the Father,
	Breathe on them from above,
	So mighty in Thy pureness,
	So tender in Thy love,
	That, guarded by Thy presence,
	From sin and strife kept free,
	Their lives may own Thy guidance,
	Their hearts be ruled by Thee.

	4. Except Thou build it, Father,
	The house is built in vain;
	Except Thou, Savior, bless it,
	The joy will turn to pain.
	But naught can break the marriage
	Of hearts in Thee made one,
	And love Thy Spirit hallows
	Is endless love begun.  Amen.

	1. The voice that breathed o'er Eden,
	1. The voice that breathed o'er Eden,
	That earliest wedding-day,
	The primal marriage blessing,--
	It hath not passed away.
	Still in the pure espousal
	Of Christian man and maid
	The Triune God is with us,
	The threefold grace is said.

	2. Be present, loving Father,
	To give away this bride
	As Thou gav'st Eve to Adam,
	A helpmeet at his side.
	Be present, Son of Mary,
	To join their loving hands
	As Thou didst bind two natures
	In Thine eternal bands.

	3. Be present, Holiest Spirit,
	To bless them as they kneel,
	As Thou for Christ, the Bridegroom,
	The heavenly Spouse dost seal.
	Oh, spread Thy pure wing o'er them,
	Let no ill power find place
	When onward to Thine altar
	Their hallowed path they trace.

	4. To cast their crowns before Thee
	In humble sacrifice,
	Till to the home of gladness
	With Christ's own Bride they rise.
	To Father, Son, and Spirit,
	Eternal One and Three,
	As was and is forever,
	All praise and glory be.

	1. O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
	1. O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
	Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne
	That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,
	Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.

	2. O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance
	Of tender charity and steadfast faith,
	Of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
	With childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.

	3. Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;
	Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife
	And to life's day the glorious unknown morrow
	That dawns uopn eternal love and life.

        1. O blessed home where man and wife
        1. O blessed home where man and wife
        Together lead a godly life,
        By deeds their faith confessing!
        There many a happy day is spent,
        There Jesus gladly will consent
        To tarry with His blessing.

        2. If they have given Him their heart,
        The place of honor set apart
        For Him each night and morrow,
        Then He the storms of life will calm,
        Will bring for every wound a balm,
        And change to joy their sorrow.

        3. And if their home be dark and drear,
        The cruse be empty, hunger near,
        All hope within them dying,
        Let them despair not in distress;
        Lo, Christ is there the bread to bless,
        The fragments multiplying.

        4. O Lord, we come before Thy face;
        In every home bestow Thy grace
        On children, father, mother.
        Relieve their wants, their burdens ease,
        Let them together dwell in peace
        And love to one another.

	1. Oh, blest the house, whate'er befall,
	1. Oh, blest the house, whate'er befall,
	Where Jesus Christ is all in all!
	Yea, if He were not dwelling there,
	How dark and poor and void it were!

	2. Oh, blest that house where faith ye find
	And all within have set their mind
	To trust their God and serve Him still
	And do in all His holy will!

	3. Oh, blest the parents who give heed
	Unto their children's foremost need
	And weary not of care or cost!
	May none to them and heaven be lost!

	4. Blest such a house, it prospers well,
	In peace and joy the parents dwell,
	And in their children's lot is shown
	How richly God can bless His own.

	5. Then here will I and mine today
	A solemn covenant make and say:
	Though all the world forsake Thy Word,
	I and my house will serve the Lord!

	1. O happy home where Thou art loved most dearly,
	1. O happy home where Thou art loved most dearly,
	Thou faithful Friend and Savior full of grace,
	And where among the guests there never cometh
	One who can hold such high and honored place!
	O happy home where all, in heart united,
	In holy faith and blessed hope are one,
	Whom bitter death a little while divideth,
	Yet cannot end the union here begun!

	2. O happy home where two, in heart united,
	In holy faith, are clinging unto Thee;
	Where both, to Thee a joyful service bringing,
	Hear and obey Thy voice most willingly;
	Where both, to Thee in truth forever cleaving,
	In joy, in grief, make Thee their only Stay
	And fondly hope in Thee to be believing
	Both in the good and in the evil day.

	3. O happy home whose little ones are given
	Early to Thee in humble faith and prayer,
	To Thee, their Friend, who from the heights of heaven
	Guides them and guards with more than mother's care!
	O happy home where each one serves Thee, lowly,
	Whatever his appointed work may be,
	Till every common task seems great and holy
	When it is done, O Lord, as unto Thee!

	4. O happy home where Thou art not forgotten
	When joy is overflowing, full, and free!
	O happy home where every wounded spirit
	Is brought, O great Physician, unto Thee,
	Until at last, when earthly toil is ended,
	All meet Thee in the blessed home above,
	From whence Thou camest, where Thou hast ascended,
	Thine everlasting home of peace and love!

	1. Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,
	1. Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,
	Children all are dear to Thee;
	Gathered with Thine arms and carried
	In Thy bosom may they be;
	Sweetly, fondly, safely, tended,
	From all want and danger free.

	2. Tender Shepherd, never leave them
	From Thy fold to go astray;
	By Thy warning love directed,
	May they walk the narrow way!
	Thus direct them, thus defend them,
	Lest they fall an easy prey.

	3. Cleanse their hearts from sinful folly
	In the stream Thy love supplied,
	Mingled stream of blood and water
	Flowing from Thy wounded side;
	And to heavenly pastures lead them,
	Where Thine own still waters glide.

	4. Let Thy holy Word instruct them;
	Fill their minds with heavenly light;
	Let Thy powerful grace constrain them
	To approve whate'er is right;
	Let them feel Thy yoke is easy,
	Let them prove Thy burden light.

	5. Taught to lisp Thy holy praises
	Which on earth Thy children sing,
	Both with lips and hearts, unfeigned,
	Glad thank-offerings may they bring;
	Then with all the saints in glory
	Join to praise their Lord and King.

	1. Shepherd of tender youth,
	1. Shepherd of tender youth,
	Guiding in love and truth
	Through devious ways;
	Christ, our triumphant King,
	We come Thy name to sing
	And here our children bring
	To join Thy praise.

	2. Thou art our Holy Lord,
	O all-subduing Word,
	Healer of strife,
	Thou didst Thyself abase
	That from sin's deep disgrace
	Thou mightest save our race
	And give us life.

	3. Thou art the great High Priest;
	Thou hast prepared the feast
	Of holy love;
	And in our mortal pain
	None calls on Thee in vain;
	Help Thou dost not disdain,
	Help from above.

	4. Ever be Thou our Guide,
	Our Shepherd and our Pride,
	Our Staff and Song;
	Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
	By Thine enduring Word
	Lead us where Thou hast trod,
	Make our faith strong.

	5. So now, and till we die,
	Sound we Thy praises high
	And joyful sing;
	Infants and the glad throng
	Who to Thy Church belong,
	Unite to swell the song
	To Christ, our King.

        1. In the name which earth and heaven
        1. In the name which earth and heaven
        Ever worship, praise, and fear,
        Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
        We a house have builded here.
        Here with prayer its deep foundations,
        In the faith of Christ did lay,
        Trusting by His help to crown it
        With the top-stone in its day.

        2. Here as in their due succession
        Stone on stone the men did place.
        Thus, we pray, unseen, but surely,
        Jesus, build us up in grace,
        Till, as in these walls completed,
        We complete in Thee are found
        And to Thee, the one Foundation,
        Stone and living stones, are bound.

        3. Fair shall be Thine earthly temple;
        Here the careless passer-by
        Shall bethink him, in its beauty,
        Of the holier house on high.
        Weary hearts and troubled spirits
        Here shall find a still retreat;
        Sinful souls shall bring their burden
        Here to the Absolver's feet.

        4. Yet with truer, nobler beauty,
        Lord, we pray, this house adorn,
        Where Thy Bride, Thy Church redeemed,
        Robes her for her marriage morn;
        Clothed in garments of salvation,
        Rich with gems of heavenly grace,
        Spouse of Christ, arrayed and waiting
        Till she may behold His face.

        5. Here in due and solemn order
        Shall her ceaseless prayer arise;
        Here shall strains of holy gladness
        Lift her heart above the skies;
        Here the Word of Life be spoken;
        Here the child of God be sealed;
        Here the Bread of Heaven be broken,
        "Till He come," Himself revealed.

        6. Praise to Thee, O Master Builder,
        Maker of the earth and skies;
        Praise to Thee, in whom Thy temple,
        Fitly framed together, lies;
        Praise to Thee, eternal Spirit,
        Binding all that lives in one
        Till our earthly praise be ended
        And the eternal song begun!

        1. O Lord of hosts, whose glory fills
        1. O Lord of hosts, whose glory fills
        The bounds of the eternal hills
        And yet vouchsaf'st, in Christian lands,
        To dwell in temples made with hands,

        2. Grant that all we who here today
        Rejoicing this foundation lay
        May be in very deed Thine own,
        Built on the precious Cornerstone.

       3. Endue the creatures with Thy grace
        That shall adorn Thy dwelling place.
        The beauty of the oak and pine,
        The gold and silver, make them Thine.

        4. To Thee they all belong, to Thee,
        The treasures of the earth and sea;
        And when we bring them to Thy throne,
        We but present Thee with Thine own.

        5. The heads that guide endue with skill,
        The hands that work preserve from ill,
        That we who these foundations lay
        May raise the top-stone in its day.

        6. Both now and ever, Lord, protect
        The temple of Thine own elect;
        Be Thou in them and they in Thee,
        O ever-blessed Trinity!

        1. Come, Jesus, from the sapphire throne,
        1. Come, Jesus, from the sapphire throne,
        Where Thy redeemed behold Thy face;
        Enter this temple, now Thine own,
        And let Thy glory fill the place.

        2. We praise Thee that today we see
        It's sacred walls before Thee stand;
        'Tis Thine for us, 'tis ours for Thee,
        Reared by Thy kind, assisting hand.

        3. Oft as returns the day of rest,
        Let heartfelt worship here ascend;
        With Thine own joy fill every breast,
        With Thine own power Thy Word attend.

        4. Here in the dark and sorrowing day
        Bid Thou the throbbing heart be still.
        Oh, wipe the mourner's tears away
        And give new strength to meet Thy will!

        5. Here in baptismal water pure
        We find for sin a gracious cure;
        Our children here to Thee we bring
        To be Thy heirs, O heavenly King.

        6. When at Thine altar we shall meet
        And keep the feast of dying love,
        Be our communion ever sweet
        With Thee and with Thy Church above.

        7. Come, faithful Shepherd, feed Thy sheep;
        In Thine own arms the lambs enfold.
        Give help to climb the heavenward steep
        Till Thy full glory we behold.

        1. Here in Thy name, eternal God,
        1. Here in Thy name, eternal God,
        We dedicate this house to Thee.
        Oh, choose it for Thy fixed abode
        And keep it from all error free!

        2. Here, when Thy people seek Thy face
        And dying sinners pray to live,
        Hear Thou in heaven, Thy dwelling-place;
        And when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive.

        3. Here, when Thy messengers proclaim
        The blessed Gospel of Thy Son,
        Still by the power of His great name
        Be mighty signs and wonders done.

        4. When children's voices raise the song,
        "Hosanna to the heavenly King!"
        Let heaven with earth the strain prolong.
        Hosanna! let the angels sing.

        5. Thy glory never hence depart.
        Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
        Thy kingdom come to every heart,
        In every bosom fix Thy throne.

        1. Great is the Lord, our God,
        1. Great is the Lord, our God,
        And let His praise be great;
        He makes His churches His abode,
        His most delightful seat.

        2. These temples of His grace,
        How beautiful they stand,
        The honors of our native place
        And bulwarks of our land!

        3. In Zion God is known,
        A Refuge in distress;
        How bright has His salvation shone,
        How fair His heavenly grace!

        4. Oft have our fathers told,
        Our eyes have often seen,
        How well our God secures the fold
        Where His own sheep have been.

        5. In every new distress
        We'll to His house repair,
        Recall to mind His wondrous grace,
        And seek deliverance there.

        1. Founded on Thee, our only Lord,
        1. Founded on Thee, our only Lord,
        On Thee, the everlasting Rock,
        Thy Church shall stand as stands Thy Word
        Nor fear the storm nor dread the shock.

        2. For Thee our waiting spirits yearn,
        For Thee this house of praises rear,
        To Thee with longing hearts we turn;
        Come, fix Thy glorious presence here.

        3. Come, with Thy Spirit and Thy power,
        The Conqueror, once the Crucified.
        Our God, our Strength, our King, our Tower,
        Here plant Thy throne and here abide.

        4. Accept the work our hands have wrought;
        Accept, O God, this earthly shrine.
        Be Thou our Rock, our Life, our Thought,
        And we, as living temples, Thine.

        1. In loud, exalted strains
        1. In loud, exalted strains
        The King of Glory praise.
        O'er heaven and earth He reigns
        Through everlasting days;
        But, Zion, thou so richly blest,
        Art His delight, His chosen rest.

        2. O King of Glory, come
        And with Thy favor crown
        This temple as Thy home,
        This people as Thy own.
        Beneath this roof vouchsafe to show
        How God can dwell with men below.

        3. Now let Thine ear attend
        Our supplicating cries;
        Now let our praise ascend,
        Accepted, to the skies;
        Now let Thy Word, the Gospel, sound,
        Spread its celestial blessing round.

        4. Here may the listening throng
        Receive Thy truth and love;
        Here Christians join the song
        Of seraphim above
        Till all who humbly seek Thy face
        Rejoice in Thy abounding grace. 

        1. One Thy Light, the Temple filling,
        1. One Thy Light, the Temple filling,
        Holy, Holy, Holy, Three!
        Meanest men and brightest angels
        Wait alike the word from Thee;
        Highest musings, lowliest worship,
        Must their preparation be.

        2. Now Thou speakest,--hear we trembling,--
        From the glory comes a voice,
        Who accepts the Almighty's mission?
        Who will make Christ's work his choice?
        Who for us proclaim to sinners,
        Turn, believe, endure, rejoice?

        3. Here are we, Redeemer, send us!
        But because Thy work is fire,
        And our lips unclean and earthly,
        Breathe no breath of high desire,
        Send Thy seraph from the altar,
        Veiled, but in his bright attire.

        4. Cause him, Lord, to fly full swiftly
        With the mystic coal in hand,
        Sin-consuming, soul-transforming,
        Faith and love will understand.
        Touch our lips, Thou wondrous Mercy,
        With Thine own keen healing brand.

        5. Thou didst come that fire to kindle;
        Fain would we Thy torches prove,
        Far and wide Thy beacons lighting
        With the undying spark of love.
        Only feed our flame, we pray Thee,
        With Thy breathings from above.

        6. Now to God, the soul's Creator,
        To His Word and Wisdom sure,
        To His all-enlightening Spirit,
        Patron of the frail and poor,
        Three in One, be praise and glory
        Here and while the heavens endure.

        1. Arise, O God, and shine
        1. Arise, O God, and shine
        In all Thy saving might
        And prosper each design
        To spread Thy glorious light;
        Let healing streams of mercy flow
        That all the earth Thy truth may know.

        2. Bring distant nations near
        To sing Thy glorious praise;
        Let every people hear
        And learn Thy holy ways.
        Reign, mighty God, assert Thy cause
        And govern for Thy righteous laws.

        3. Put forth Thy glorious power
        That Gentiles all may see
        And earth present her store
        In converts born to Thee.
        God, our God, His Church will bless
        And fill the world with righteousness.

        4. To God, the only Wise,
        The one immortal King,
        Let hallelujahs rise
        From every living thing;
        Let all that breathe, on every coast,
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
        
        1. Holy Father, in Thy mercy
        1. Holy Father, in Thy mercy
        Hear our anxious prayer;
        Keep our loved ones who are absent
        'Neath Thy care.

        2. Jesus, Savior, let Thy presence
        Be their light and guide;
        Keep, oh, keep them in their weakness
        At Thy side.

        3. When in sorrow, when in danger,
        When in loneliness,
        In Thy love look down and comfort
        Their distress.

        4. May the joy of Thy salvation
        Be their strength and stay!
        May they love and may they praise Thee
        Day by day!

        5. Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
        Sanctify their life;
        Send Thy grace that they may conquer
        In the strife.

        6. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
        God the One in Three,
        Bless them, guide them, save them, keep them,
        Near to Thee.

        1. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
        1. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
        Praise Him, all creatures here below;
        Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host:
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

        1. Behold a branch is growing
        1. Behold a branch is growing
        As of loveliest form and grace,
        As prophets sung, foreknowing;
        It springs from Jesse's race
        And bears one little Flower
        In midst of coldest winter,
        At deepest midnight hour.

        2. Isaiah hath foretold It
        In words of promise sure,
        And Mary s arms enfold It,
        A virgin meek and pure.
        Through God's eternal will
        This Child to her is given
        At midnight calm and still.

        3. The shepherds heard the story,
        Proclaimed by angels bright,
        How Christ, the Lord of Glory,
        Was born on earth this night.
        To Bethlehem they sped
        And in the manger found him,
        As angel heralds said.

        4. This Flower, whose fragrance tender
        With sweetness fills the air,
        Dispels with glorious splendor
        The darkness everywhere.
        True Man, yet very God;
        From sin and death He saves us
        And lightens every load.

        5. 0 Savior, Child of Mary,
        Who felt our human woe;
        Savior, King of Glory.
        Who dost our weakness know,
        Bring us at length, we pray.
        To the bright courts of heaven
        And to the endless day.

        1. Silent night! Holy night!
        1. Silent night! Holy night!
        All is calm, all is bright,
        Round yon Virgin Mother and Child.
        Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
        Sleep in heavenly peace,
        Sleep in heavenly peace.

        2. Silent night! Holy night!
        Shepherds quake at the sight;
        Glories stream from heaven afar,
        Heavenly hosts sing, Alleluia.
        Christ, the Savior, is born!
        Christ, the Savior, is born!

        3. Silent night! Holy night!
        Son of God, love's pure light
        Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
        With the dawn of redeeming grace,
        Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
        Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

        1. O little town of Bethlehem,
        1. O little town of Bethlehem,
        How still we see thee lie!
        Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
        The silent stars go by;
        Yet in thy darkness shineth
        The everlasting Light;
        The hopes and fears of all the years
        Are met in thee tonight.

        2. For Christ is born of Mary,
        And fathered all above,
        While mortals sleep, the angels keep
        Their watch of wondering love.
        O morning stars, together
        Proclaim the holy birth
        And praises sing to God, the King,
        And peace to men on earth.

        3. How silently, how silently,
        The wondrous Gift is given!
        So God imparts to human hearts
        The blessings of His heaven.
        No ear may hear His coming,
        But in this world of sin,
        Where meek souls will receive Him still,
        The dear Christ enters in.

        4. O holy Child of Bethlehem,
        Descend to us, we pray;
        Cast out our sin and enter in,
        Be born in us today.
        We hear the Christmas angels
        The great glad tidings tell:
        Oh, come to us, abide with us,
        Our Lord Immanuel!

        1. I am Jesus little lamb,
        1. I am Jesus little lamb,
        Ever glad at heart I am;
        For my Shepherd gently guides me,
        Knows my need, and well provides me,
        Loves me every day the same,
        Even calls me by my name.

        2. Day by day, at home, away,
        Jesus is my Staff and Stay.
        When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,
        Into pleasant pastures leads me;
        When I thirst, He bids me go
        Where the quiet waters flow.

        3. Who so happy as I am,
        Even now the Shepherd's lamb?
        And when my short life is ended,
        By His angel host attended,
        He shall fold me to His breast,
        There within His arms to rest.

        1. Jesus, Savior, pilot me
        1. Jesus, Savior, pilot me
        Over life's tempestuous sea;
        Unknown waves before me roll,
        Hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
        Chart and compass come from Thee:
        Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

        2. As a mother stills her child,
        Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
        Boisterous waves obey Thy will
        When Thou say'st to them, "Be still!"
        Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,
        Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

        3. When at last I near the shore,
        And the fearful breakers roar
        'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
        Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
        May I hear Thee say to me,
        "Fear not, I will pilot thee."

        1. Behold a Stranger at the door!
        1. Behold a Stranger at the door!
        He gently knocks, has knocked before,
        Has waited long, is waiting still;
        You treat no other friend so ill.

        2. But will He prove a friend indeed?
        He will; the very Friend you need;
        The Friend of sinners--yes 'tis He,
        With garments dyed on Calvary.

        3. O lovely attitude! He stands
        Wih melting heart and laden hands;
        O matchless kindness! and He shows
        This matchless kindness to His foes.

        4. Admit Him lest His anger burn
        And He, departing, ne'er return;
        Admit Him, or the hour's at hand
        When at His door denied you'll stand.

        5. Oh, let the heavenly stranger in,
        Let in thy heart His reign begin.
        Admit Him, open wide the door,
        And He will bless thee evermore.

        1. Be still, my soul; the Lord is on thy side;
        1. Be still, my soul; the Lord is on thy side;
        Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
        Leave to thy God to order and provide;
        In every change He faithful will remain.
        Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly, Friend
        Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

        2. Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake
        To guide the future as He has the past.
        Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake;
        All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
        Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know
        His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

        3. Be still, my soul, though dearest friends depart
        And all is darkened in the vale of tears;
        Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,
        Who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears.
        Be still, my soul; thy Jesus can repay
        From His own fulness all He takes away.

        4. Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
        When we shall be forever with the Lord,
        When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
        Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
        Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
        All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

        1. I lay my sins on Jesus,
        1. I lay my sins on Jesus,
        The spotless Lamb of God;
        He bears them all and frees us
        From the accursed load.
        I bring my guilt to Jesus
        To wash my crimson stains
        White in His blood most precious
        Till not a spot remains.

        2. I lay my wants on Jesus,
        All fulness dwells in Him;
        He healeth my diseases,
        He doth my soul redeem.
        I lay my griefs on Jesus,
        My burdens and my cares;
        He from them all releases,
        He all my sorrows shares.

        3. I rest my soul on Jesus,
        This weary soul of mine;
        His right hand me embraces,
        I on His breast recline.
        I love the name of Jesus,
        Immanuel, Christ the Lord;
        Like fragrance on the breezes
        His name abroad is poured.

        4. I long to be like Jesus,
        Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
        I long to be like Jesus,
        The Father's holy Child.
        I long to be with Jesus
        Amid the heavenly throng
        To sing with saints His praises,
        To learn the angels song.

        1. Now the light has gone away;
        1. Now the light has gone away;
        Father, listen while I pray,
        Asking Thee to watch and keep
        And to send me quiet sleep.

        2. Jesus, Savior, wash away
        All that has been wrong today;
        Help me every day to be
        Good and gentle, more like Thee.

        3. Let my near and dear ones be
        Always near and dear to Thee.
        Oh, bring me and all I love
        To Thy happy home above.

        4. Now my evening praise I give;
        Thou didst die that I might live.
        All my blessings come from The;
        Oh, how good Thou art to me!

	5. Thou, my best and kindest Friend,
	Thou wilt love me to the end.
	Let me love Thee more and more,
	Always better than before.

        1. Now the day is over,
        1. Now the day is over,
        Night is drawing nigh;
        Shadows of the evening
        Steal across the sky.

        2. Now the darkness gathers,
        Stars begin to peep,
        Birds and beasts and flowers
        Soon will be asleep.

        3. Jesus, give the weary
        Calm and sweet repose;
        With Thy tend'rest blessing
        May mine eyelids close.

        4. Grant to little children
        Visions bright of Thee;
        Guard the sailors tossing
        On the deep-blue sea.

        5. Comfort every sufferer
        Watching late in pain;
        Those who plan some evil
        From their sin restrain.

        6. Through the long night-watches
        May Thine angels spread
        Their white wings above me,
        Watching round my bed.

        7. When the morning wakens,
        Then may I arise
        Pure and fresh and sinless
        In Thy holy eyes.

        8. Glory to the Father,
        Glory to the Son,
        And to Thee, blest Spirit,
        While all ages run.

        1. I pray Thee, dear Lord Jesus,
        1. I pray Thee, dear Lord Jesus,
        My heart to keep and train
        That I Thy holy temple
        From youth to age remain.
        Turn Thou my thoughts forever
        From worldly wisdom's lore;
        If I but learn to know Thee,
        I shall not want for more.

        1. Behold a host, arrayed in white,
        1. Behold a host, arrayed in white,
        Like thousand snow-clad mountains bright,
        With palms they stand. Who is this band
        Before the throne of light?
        Lo, these are they of glorious fame
        Who from the great affliction came
        And in the flood of Jesus blood
        Are cleansed from guilt and blame.
        Now gathered in the holy place,
        Their voices they in worship raise,
        Their anthems swell where God doth dwell,
        Mid angels songs of praise.

        2. Despised and scorned, they sojourned here;
        But now, how glorious they must appear!
        Those martyrs stand a priestly band,
        God's throne forever near.
        So oft, in troubled days gone by,
        In anguish they would weep and sigh,
        At home above the God of Love
        For aye their tears shall dry.
        They now enjoy their Sabbath rest,
        The paschal banquet of the blest;
        The Lamb, their Lord, at festal board
        Himself is Host and Guest.

        3. Then hail, ye mighty legions, yea,
        All hail! Now safe and blest for aye,
        And praise the Lord, who with His Word
        Sustained you on the way.
        Ye did the joys of earth disdain,
        Ye toiled and sowed in tears and pain.
        Farewell, now bring your sheaves and sing
        Salvation's glad refrain.
        Swing high your palms, lift up your song,
        Yea, make it myriad voices strong,
        Eternally shall praise to Thee,
        God, and the Lamb belong.

        1. Beautiful Savior,
        1. Beautiful Savior,
        King of Creation,
        Son of God and Son of Man!
        Truly I'd love Thee,
        Truly I'd serve Thee,
        Light of my soul, my Joy, my Crown.

        2. Fair are the meadows,
        Fair are the woodlands,
        Robed in flowers of blooming spring;
        Jesus is fairer,
        Jesus is purer;
        He makes our sorrowing spirit sing.

        3. Fair is the sunshine,
        Fair is the moonlight,
        Bright the sparkling stars on high;
        Jesus shines brighter,
        Jesus shines purer,
        Than all the angels in the sky.

        4. Beautiful Savior,
        Lord of the nations,
        Son of God and Son of Man!
        Glory and honor,
        Praise, adoration,
        Now and forevermore be Thine!

        1. Onward, Christian soldiers,
        1. Onward, Christian soldiers,
        Marching as to war,
        With the cross of Jesus
        Going on before.
        Christ, the royal Master,
        Leads against the Foe;
        Forward into battle
        See His banners go!
        Onward, Christian soldiers,
        Marching as to war,
        With the cross of Jesus
        Going on before.

        2. Like a mighty army
        Moves the Church of God;
        Brothers, we are treading
        Where the saints have trod.
        We are not divided,
        All one body we,
        One in hope and doctrine,
        One in charity.
        Onward, Christian soldiers,
        Marching as to war,
        With the cross of Jesus
        Going on before.

        3. Crowns and thrones may perish,
        Kingdoms rise and wane,
        But the Church of Jesus
        Constant will remain.
        Gates of hell can never
        'Gainst that Church prevail;
        We have Christ's own promise,
        And that cannot fail.
        Onward, Christian soldiers,
        Marching as to war,
        With the cross of Jesus
        Going on before.

        4. Onward, then, ye faithful,
        Join our happy throng,
        Blend with ours your voices
        In the triumph-song;
        Glory, laud, and honor
        Unto Christ the King;
        This, through countless ages,
        Men and angels sing.
        Onward, Christian soldiers,
        Marching as to war,
        With the cross of Jesus
        Going on before.

        1. I'm but a stranger here,
        1. I'm but a stranger here,
        Heav'n is my home;
        Earth is a desert dread,
        Heav'n is my home.
        Danger and sorrow stand
        Round me on every hand;
        Heav'n is my fatherland,
        Heav'n is my home.

        2. What though the tempest rage,
        Heav'n is my home;
        Short is my pilgrimage,
        Heav'n is my home;
        And time's wild wintry blast
        Soon shall be overpast;
        I shall reach home at last,
        Heav'n is my home.

        3. There at my Savior's side
        Heav'n is my home;
        I shall be glorified,
        Heav'n is my home;
        There are the good and blest,
        Those I love most and best;
        And there I, too, shall rest,
        Heav'n is my home.

        4. Therefore I murmur not,
        Heav'n is my home;
        Whate'er my earthly lot,
        Heav'n is my home;
        And I shall surely stand
        There at my Lord's right hand.
        Heav'n is my fatherland,
        Heav'n is my home.
